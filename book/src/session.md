# Game embedding (the `Session`)

`ferroplan::solve` re-parses and re-grounds on every call — dead weight if
you're solving the *same world* every tick: a game's villagers, a
simulation loop, an agent runtime. A **`Session`** is the embedding API for
that case. It parses, compiles axioms, and grounds **once**, then holds the
current world state. Every "think" after that pays only for the search.

Everything below is deterministic, thread-count independent: same session
state, same budget, same goal — byte-identical plans at any `threads`
setting.

```rust,no_run
use ferroplan::{Options, Session};
# let (domain_src, problem_src) = (String::new(), String::new());
let mut s = Session::new(&domain_src, &problem_src, &Options::default())?;
let first = s.replan();                       // plan from the problem's :init
s.set_fact("(at vera field)", true)?;         // the world moved
s.set_fluent("(grain)", 3.0)?;
let next = s.replan();                        // replan from HERE
# Ok::<(), String>(())
```

Classical, numeric, and ADL domains work here — and, since 0.12,
**temporal (durative-action) domains**: thinks come back timed,
genuinely concurrent, per-step `time`/`duration` and a `makespan` attached.

## Bounded thinks

`replan_budgeted(max_evaluated, memory_mb)` is the real-time surface: an
**eval budget** (the deterministic unit — never wall clock) and a memory
target. A think returns a plan or it doesn't. If it doesn't, that's an
honest budget-exhausted `solved: false` — the game reacts: think again
later, escalate, fall back.

## Follow before you rethink

`plan_still_valid(&plan, from_step)` replays a plan's remaining suffix
against the current state — **no search, no budget**. An agent whose world
drifted somewhere irrelevant keeps following its plan for free; only a
broken suffix earns a real rethink. When one breaks,
`replan_following(&plan, from_step, budget, memory_mb)` biases the rethink
toward the break: replays the still-applicable prefix, searches only for a
new tail. Plan **churn** stays confined to what drift actually broke
(measured: a deep break re-plans in 3 evals, churn 1, where an unbiased
rethink burns 2,899 evals churning 16 steps). No tail, no bias — it falls
back to an unbiased rethink. The bias can cost budget. It never costs
completeness.

## One world, changing desires

`set_goal("(and (has a0 item5) …)")` retargets a session with **zero
regrounding** — any ground conjunction (atoms, negated atoms with
grounded mirrors, numeric comparisons) over the already-interned fact
space. A desire the world can't express comes back an honest error, never
a silent unsolvable. `goal_met()` is the pure state test — "is it done
*now*" — a different question from a think's "could I still plan."

## One grounding, a population of minds

`fork()` clones a mind over the **same grounded world**: the grounded
payload — operator tables, names, indexes — sits shared behind `Arc`, so N
minds cost one grounding plus kilobytes of private state apiece. Measured
on the vendored bazaar: 12 NPCs fork in ~0 ms, **+0 MB** RSS. Forks start
from the parent's current state and goal, then go their own way — no
fork's writes or tie-breaks ever touch a sibling.

`restrict_ops(|display| …)` scopes a mind to **its own actions** — the
correctness primitive for a population of minds. A rival's moves reach it
only as `set_fact` drift, never as plan steps; loop-side policies (masking
exchanges a rival's plan has already claimed, say) compose on top of it.
The [`bazaar_live` example](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/crates/ferroplan/examples/bazaar_live.rs)
runs the whole tick loop — the
[browser demo replays a real run](./demo/bazaar-live.html).

## The scheduled world

`set_timed_fact(dt, "(power)", false)` plants a **clock-relative** event: in
`dt` time units, the fact flips. Pending events ride into every temporal
think — plans beat closing windows or fail honestly, and can *wait through*
an outage whose repair is already scheduled — and into `plan_still_valid`
replays too. `elapse(dt)` moves the schedule forward as the game's clock
advances, firing whatever's due. (Absolute-clock TILs stay rejected at
construction: session time is always relative to *now*.)

The domain contract: a scheduled fact has to be **dynamic** — touched by
some action in the domain. A truly static fact gets compiled straight into
the grounded operators; flipping it at runtime couldn't soundly change
behavior. Model exogenous-changeable facts (market-open, power) with an
action that touches them.

## In-flight intervals

`apply_start("(fire urn)")` starts a durative action **now**: start
effects apply, its end joins the session's in-flight set. Thinks happen
**mid-interval** — plans cover what's left, never restart a running
action, stay valid *through* every pending end (a think can even be pure
waiting: zero steps, makespan = the pending end's moment).
`elapse(dt)` fires due interval ends with their own at-end effects. An end
whose preconditions drift broke gets reported, its effects dropped — the
game decides what a ruined firing means.

## Belief and observation (fog)

A mind's session **is** a belief state: a world copy that drifts from the
authoritative one. `observe(&[(fact, value)])` is the seeing surface —
sighted facts snap to observed truth, everything else stays *believed*,
and the call hands back exactly the facts whose value differed from
belief: the **surprises**. Feed the news to `plan_still_valid` / `goal_met`
and rethink only when observation breaks something — surprise-driven
rethinks, not wall-clock paranoia. The fogged bazaar loop (`bazaar_live`,
the `claims + fog` rows in
[`benchmarks/bazaar-thinks.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/benchmarks/bazaar-thinks.md))
shows the measured shape: a mind sees its own stall each turn, its trading
partner's stall on arrival. A theft at a third-party stall surfaces on
contact, one tick late — information asymmetry visibly reshuffles who
wins, deterministically, at any thread count.

## Fences (why some writes are errors)

Honesty over silent wrongness, everywhere:

- **Static facts** get rejected by `set_fact`/`set_timed_fact`: grounding
  enumerates operators against statics, so flipping one could demand
  operators that were never enumerated in the first place.
- **`RUNNING-*` tokens** (the temporal compiler's interval bookkeeping)
  stay managed by `apply_start`/`elapse` — never by hand.
- **ADL goal connectives** in `set_goal` (or goals over never-interned
  atoms) error out with the reason. Recreate the session for an ADL goal.
- **PDDL3 constraints/preferences** and **absolute-clock TILs** get
  rejected at construction, with pointers to the per-solve API.

`world_bytes()` / `mind_bytes()` report the shared-vs-private memory split
(flat-byte floors) for embedders budgeting a population.
