# Tuning & environment knobs

ferroplan's defaults are chosen so that a plain `ff -o domain -f problem` is the
measured-best path — you should rarely need any of these. When you do, every knob is
an **environment variable**, read at solve time. Reads are panic-free on
`wasm32`; the boolean features additionally have in-process overrides in
[`ferroplan::features`](https://docs.rs/ferroplan) (`set_overrides`,
`set_escalate_override`, `set_espc_override`) for WASM/embedded callers, where
`std::env::set_var` panics.

Almost every knob is a **restore hatch**: it exists to reproduce an earlier
behavior or to run an experiment, and the default is the recommended setting. All
results are deterministic and thread-count independent.

## Temporal

| var | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FF_TDEMAND` | numeric-only | force the **Full** demand tier (also seed demand from predicate-goal thresholds) *first*, for conjunctive/structural builds. |
| `FF_NO_TDEMAND` | — | master switch to the pristine pre-v0.2 path: no demand guidance, no relevance pruning, no escalation. |
| `FF_NOREL` | — | disable goal-relevance pruning alone (keep demand guidance). |
| `FF_NO_ESCALATE` | ladder on | disable the on-failure escalation ladder (retry Full tier, then decomposer). Only affects would-be failures. |
| `FF_TDECOMP` | off | route the temporal path through the partition-and-resolve decomposer first (the `decompose` API always does, regardless). |
| `FF_TCONC` | off | run the concurrent scheduling phase — repack a plan onto actor objects to minimize makespan. |
| `FF_TDEMAND_W` | `3` | weight of the temporal demand seed. |
| `FF_NO_TSYMM` | symmetry on | disable the 0.13 pending-interval **symmetry reduction** (canonical agenda order + redundant identical-interval elimination). The restore hatch for its one named corpus casualty (parking-2011 #16). |
| `FF_TEMPORAL_NODE_CAP` | byte model | override the deterministic temporal stored-node cap directly (`0` disables; default derives from the memory target and static task dims). |
| `FF_TEMPORAL_ABS_KEY` | relative | restore ABSOLUTE agenda times in the visited key on TIL-free tasks (the pre-0.10 behavior; relative keying dedups retimed permutations). |
| `FF_TLAMA` | off | **experimental**: the temporal LAMA rung (fact-landmark-dominant key). Measured negative — snap-task landmarks are RUNNING-token chains with no branching signal. |
| `FF_LAX_HELPFUL` | off | **experimental**: re-arm empty temporal helpful sets with a lax fallback instead of a full scan. Measured zero new solves. |
| `FF_TAGENDA_W` | `0` | **experimental**: complete-pass agenda-size ordering term (de-prioritize interval hoarding). Measured negative on parc-printer-t. |
| `FF_NO_FIXPOINT_GROUND` | fixpoint (Session) | make the `Session`'s temporal entry use stratified grounding instead of reached-restricted **fixpoint grounding** (the ~117× transient-memory win on sparse-reachable worlds). Corpus/CLI paths always use stratified — their tie-breaks pin the scoreboard baselines. |
| `FF_NO_ORBIT` | orbits on | disable **object-symmetry orbit** detection (0.14): goal-respecting member permutations canonicalize the temporal visited key, collapsing states that differ only by relabeling interchangeable objects/goal pairs (machine-shop's wall; rescues turn-and-open under the sound invariant semantics). |
| `FF_ORBIT_DEBUG` | off | narrate orbit detection (candidate groups, bail reasons) and per-solve eval counts on stderr — the probe eyes, never affects the search. |
| `FF_ORBIT_GEN` | off | **experimental**: generation-side stabilizer skipping (0.15): with orbits detected, an op whose state-fixing member swap maps it to an already-generated sibling is never generated (TMS: 2.4× real evals at equal budget; duplicates 81% → 53% — but zero new solves, since TMS's wall is the start-credit plateau, not throughput). The 0.15 sweep referee flipped it opt-in: the per-expansion stabilizer scan cost match-cellar 9 solved instances. The canonical-key pre-dedup stays default-on. |
| `FF_TLIFO` | off | **experimental**: LIFO tie-breaking at equal temporal keys. Measured WORSE on the TMS plateau (best_h 150 vs 110) — dives a high-h corridor. |
| `FF_TB_FREE_G` | off | **experimental**: don't charge g for time-advance successors. Measured WORSE on TMS (best_h 196) — rides time forward, wasting windows. |
| `FF_TAGENDA_W_PRUNE` | `0` | **experimental**: the agenda-size term on the PRUNED pass (start-credit counter-account). Measured worse on TMS (best_h 173) though it does push the search deep enough for window blocking to engage. |
| `FF_TEVAL_BUDGET` | unlimited | cap CLI temporal search **evaluations** — the deterministic measuring stick for A/B probes (eval budgets, never wall clock). |

## Classical search (experiments & restore hatches)

| var | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FF_NOVELTY` | auto |  the width-1 BFWS-style novelty rung (0.17) — a third bounded classical rung after EHC and LAMA fail, open list ordered by state novelty then h. 0.19: DEFAULT-ON when `FF_TIME_LIMIT` is declared and >40% of the budget remains (the 0.18 gated referee measured +4/−0, reversing 0.17's ungated +7/−51 tax); `FF_NO_NOVELTY=1` opts out, `FF_NOVELTY=1` forces it without a budget. No budget declared ⇒ rung off, byte-identical ladder. `FF_NOVELTY_ONLY=1` probes the rung alone. |
| `FF_TIME_LIMIT` | unset | the process's REAL wall budget in seconds (0.18 budget-aware ladder). The clock arms at solve entry (grounding counts as spent budget); a bounded rung (LAMA, novelty) is entered only while **more than 40% of the budget remains**, so late-ladder rungs stop starving the complete fallback near the budget edge — the mechanism behind the novelty referee's −51. Unset = all-rungs behavior, byte-identical to 0.17. `benchmarks/ipc67.py` passes its per-instance `--timeout` automatically. Informational, never kills the process. `FF_WALL_DEBUG=1` narrates the gate's verdict on stderr (the probe eyes, never affects the search). |
| `FF_NO_DNF_STATIC` | resolve | disable static resolution inside precondition DNF expansion (restore the 2^k `imply` blowup the 0.10 fix removed — openstacks-ADL 6/30 → 30/30). |
| `FF_NO_TRAJ_END` | end-action | restore the exponential goal-DNF construction for hard trajectory monitors (pre-0.8). |
| `FF_CLM` | off | **experimental**: classical landmark-count guidance term. Measured negative (transport unchanged, floor-tile worse). |
| `FF_LEN_ANYTIME` | off | **experimental**: keep draining the open list after the first plan, returning the shortest found. Measured −9 coverage at 60 s; opt-in only. |
| `FF_LEN_SWEEP_EVALS` | off | **experimental**: iterated-weight anytime re-sweeps for unit-cost plan length (~1.8% shorter at ~28× evals). |

## PDDL3 preference optimizer

The default path is the exact-closure metric optimizer; these restore its
predecessor pieces or tune its budget.

| var | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FF_PREF_EVAL_BUDGET` | `2000000` | deterministic per-solve eval budget — **the real quality dial**. Higher = more optimization time on hard instances. |
| `FF_PREF_NO_ESCALATE` | escalate | disable the budget-escalating retry (abandon a probe on its first capped iteration). |
| `FF_PREF_GREEDY` | anytime | restore first-improvement sweeps: return at the first plan under the bound and restart, instead of tightening the bound in place and draining the sweep. |
| `FF_PREF_NO_RESTARTS` | ladder on | disable the diversified restart ladder (rotated open-list weight profiles on a capped no-improvement sweep) — the lever behind the storage p06/p07 and pathways p05 wins. |
| `FF_PREF_SEED` | off | **experimental**: forgo-aware second seed — price each preference's completion with a cost-aware relaxed plan and pre-forgo those priced over their weight. Measured neutral on rovers (the EHC seed already lands there). |
| `FF_PREF_SEED3` | off | **experimental**: partitioned closure seed — compose a per-preference-component incumbent (mutex-conflict-pruned, sibling-protected stages) before the tightening loop. Composes genuinely (tpp p05: 99 vs the 105 init-tail) but measured neutral on finals: the anytime+ladder loop reaches the same metric from either bound. |
| `FF_PREF_NO_SELECT` | select on | disable the 0.6 **selection layer** (exact preference-subset selection solved combinatorially, then planned as a hard-goal target; `docs/forensics-tpp.md`). Selection is what ties SGPlan5 on tpp p06 and widened the rovers totals lead; its bounded seed runs outside the tightening budget. |
| `FF_PREF_NO_STATIC` | simplify | disable static preference simplification at compile (keep statically-satisfied instances). |
| `FF_PREF_NO_BARRIER` | barrier on | exclude init-satisfied preferences from the guidance (the 0.4–0.5.0 behavior). Keeping them (the 0.5.1 default) protects high-weight trap preferences — the storage 8/8 sweep — see `docs/forensics-tpp.md`. `FF_PREF_BARRIER` is accepted, now redundant. |
| `FF_PREF_COMPILED` | closure | route through the legacy compiled-goal B&B instead of the exact-closure optimizer. |
| `FF_PREF_NUMLEGACY` | closure | folded **numeric** metrics only (rovers-shaped): restore the pre-0.5 routing to the legacy B&B. The closure path now dominates it (rovers flipped to a domain lead). |
| `FF_PREF_COST_WEIGHT` | domain-dependent | cost-aware open-list weight (`SearchCfg::w_c`). **Experimental** — a measured dead end on rovers; default 0 there. |
| `FF_RES_WEIGHT` / `FF_RES_THRESH` | tuned / `0` | satisfaction-guidance resource penalty weight / threshold. |
| `FF_DEADLINE_WEIGHT` | `0` | extra penalty on deadline-pair triggers in satisfaction guidance. |
| `FF_RES_DEBUG` | — | print resource/preference simplification diagnostics. |

## ESPC penalty loop (default-on where it bites)

The extended-saddle-point penalty loop for resource-coupled preference domains
(openstacks-shaped). **On by default since 0.5**, with a deterministic
evaluated-state budget; it engages only when the compiled task carries once-only
conditional-achievement deadline pairs — on every other task it is a verified
no-op.

| var | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FF_NO_ESPC` | espc on | **opt out** — restore the closure-optimizer-only default path. |
| `FF_ESPC_EVAL_BUDGET` | `6000000` | deterministic eval pool for the loop (λ iterations + polish) — the primary budget contract, thread-count independent. |
| `FF_ESPC_TIME_MS` | unset | optional **additional** wall-clock cap for interactive use. Applies only when set; setting it trades determinism for latency. |
| `FF_ESPC_MONO` | partitioned | reproduce the earlier monolithic (pre-0.4.0) loop. |
| `FF_ESPC` | — | accepted for compatibility (pre-0.5 opt-in); redundant now. |

Advanced ESPC schedule tuning (rarely needed): `FF_ESPC_OUTER` (outer iterations),
`FF_ESPC_RATE` (initial penalty rate, `20`), `FF_ESPC_K` (consecutive-violation
rate bump, `2`), `FF_ESPC_LAMBDA0` (initial λ, `0`), `FF_ESPC_STALL` (stall limit
before termination, `4`).

## PDDL3 trajectory constraints

| var | default | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `FF_CONSTRAINTS_REJECT` | enforce | restore the 0.4.1–0.6 blanket **rejection** of every `(:constraints ...)` block, instead of compiling the untimed operators into enforced monitor automata (0.7) — hard constraints as goal conjuncts, soft `(preference ...)` constraints priced through the PDDL3 metric machinery. The hatch restores *rejection*, not ignoring — no setting makes ferroplan silently drop a constraint. |

## Reproducing a specific benchmark

The [IPC-5 scoreboard](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/benchmarks/ipc5-scoreboard.md)
records the exact env for each domain — e.g. openstacks's domain lead is
`FF_ESPC=1 FF_ESPC_TIME_MS=90000`.
