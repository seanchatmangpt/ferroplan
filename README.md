A fast, data-parallel **PDDL planner** in Rust — a deterministic planning core for
the age of AI.

**The bet:** an LLM should be the *author and supervisor* of a planner, not its
runtime. The same reason you don't ask a model to add a column of numbers — you have
it emit code that does the arithmetic deterministically, and for free — applies one
level up: don't ask an LLM to *be* the planner for a whole village of agents. Have it
author a PDDL domain that then plans deterministically, cheaply, and inspectably at
scale, and let it only *nudge* that domain at runtime. PDDL is the auditable interface
between your intent, the model's authoring, and a fast solver — and `ferroplan` is
that solver.

**Why PDDL, not prompt-spaghetti:**

- **Cost** — a solved domain plans essentially for free; an LLM call per decision per agent does not.
- **Determinism** — same problem, same plan; you can regression-test it.
- **Inspectability** — you can read a domain and an axiom; you cannot read a model's weights.
- **Scale** — a village of agents each replanning is tractable for a fast solver, not as a wall of LLM calls.

`ferroplan` is a from-scratch reimplementation of the FF family of planners with a
data-oriented core (bitset states, structure-of-arrays / CSR operator tables),
**enforced hill-climbing** (EHC) with a best-first fallback, parallel grounding
and parallel heuristic evaluation, plus an SGPlan-style partition-and-resolve mode,
PDDL3 preference/metric optimization, and **PDDL2.1 temporal** planning (durative
actions). It ships both a **library** (with a structured, JSON-serializable API)
and the **`ff`** command-line binary — a drop-in for Metric-FF's
`ff -o domain -f problem`.

On classical and ADL benchmarks it runs within ~1.4× of the heavily-optimized C
Metric-FF (EHC reaches goals in dozens of evaluations, not thousands); numeric
trails and IPC-5 preference quality is competitive-not-winning — see
[Benchmarks](#benchmarks).

> Status: **v0.19.0** — `ferroplan` + `ferroplan-cli` are on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ferroplan). APIs may shift before 1.0.

> **What's new in 0.19.0 — the contest cycle.** The standings push,
> by direct request: ~120 instances came back from the FRONT DOOR
> (negative-literal lexing + the implicit `total-cost` convention —
> reject columns 60 → 0 and 60 → 1), and the numeric heuristic
> learned linear gradients (**2023 numeric 113 → 165 valid**,
> farmland/fo-farmland +17 each). The historic fence fell: ferroplan
> now has an OPTIMAL mode (`--mode optimal`, A* + admissible h^max,
> proof-or-nothing) and **252 certified optima across three
> newly-entered seq-opt tracks** (2008/2011/2014), every certificate
> VAL-green and oracle-cross-checked. The novelty rung runs by
> default under a declared wall budget (+16/−0 on 2018-sat at the
> cut; the 580-instance flagship moved for the first time in three
> cycles, 441 → 452), the node cap now respects the actual RLIMIT,
> and the 2023 agile board carries an official-budget 300 s ENTRY.

> **What's new in 0.13.0 — the many-minds cycle.** One world, a

## Features

- **EHC + best-first** — enforced hill-climbing with helpful actions (the FF
  speed default), falling back to weighted best-first when it stalls. Selectable
  per solve (`--search auto|ehc|best-first|…`).
- **FF heuristic** — delete-relaxation relaxed-plan heuristic over a
  data-oriented task, deferred evaluation, tunable `g`/`h` weights.
- **Data parallelism** — parallel grounding and parallel batch heuristic
  evaluation (`std::thread`); the plan found is identical for any thread count.
- **PDDL coverage** — STRIPS, typing, negative/disjunctive preconditions,
  numeric fluents (Metric-FF style), **ADL** (conditional effects,
  `forall`/`exists`, equality), and **derived predicates / axioms** (`:derived`,
  static/stratified — closed into the initial state via a datalog fixpoint).
- **PDDL3 preferences** — soft goal preferences (incl. `forall`-quantified and
  precondition preferences) compiled away, with anytime branch-and-bound metric
  optimization. *(Exact-optimal on small/medium instances; best-found, flagged,
  on the largest — see [Limitations](#limitations).)*
- **PDDL2.1 temporal** — `:durative-action`s with `at start`/`over all`/`at end`
  conditions & effects, **constant or parameter-dependent durations**, and
  required concurrency, via a decision-epoch forward search; output in the IPC
  temporal plan format (`t: (action) [dur]`) with a makespan.
- **SGPlan-style partitioning** — an optional partition-and-resolve mode.
- **Robust** — a published library shouldn't crash: malformed/pathological PDDL
  (incl. deeply-nested forms) returns a typed error, never a panic.
- **Structured output** — the library returns typed, `serde`-serializable
  results; the CLI emits classic FF text **or** JSON.

## GUI

[`ferroplan-bevy`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/crates/ferroplan-bevy) is a Bevy app that visualizes a
domain+problem as a typed graph, animates the plan, and edits both problems and
domains in a Blockly-style block editor (`cargo run -p ferroplan-bevy`).

![ferroplan-bevy visualizing a delivery problem as a typed graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/main/book/src/images/graph.png)

## Install / build

```sh
# install the `ff` CLI from crates.io
cargo install ferroplan-cli    # puts `ff` on your PATH

# …or build from a clone
cargo build --release          # produces target/release/ff
cargo run --release --bin ff -- -o domain.pddl -f problem.pddl
```

As a library dependency: `cargo add ferroplan` (see [Library](#library) below).

## CLI (`ff`)

```sh
# drop-in: classic Metric-FF text output
ff -o domain.pddl -f problem.pddl

# structured JSON solution
ff -o domain.pddl -f problem.pddl --json

# pick a mode / search strategy
ff -o domain.pddl -f problem.pddl --mode partition
ff -o domain.pddl -f problem.pddl --search best-first --weight-h 3

# temporal (durative actions) — auto-detected; prints the IPC temporal plan
ff -o temporal-domain.pddl -f problem.pddl --mode temporal

# decompose a too-big temporal goal into ordered, individually-solved contracts
# (the "LLM authors, planner decomposes" bet, made inspectable — text or --json)
ff -o temporal-domain.pddl -f problem.pddl --mode temporal --decompose

# self-contained JSON job: {"domain": "...", "problem": "...", "options": {...}}
ff --json-request job.json
```

Run `ff --help` for all flags (`--search`, `--weight-g/--weight-h`,
`--max-evaluated`, `--satisfice`, `--threads`, …).

## Library

```rust
use ferroplan::{solve, Options};

let domain  = std::fs::read_to_string("domain.pddl")?;
let problem = std::fs::read_to_string("problem.pddl")?;

// Syntax-check before solving (no grounding/solving) — fast authoring feedback.
let report = ferroplan::parse(&domain);
assert!(report.ok, "{:?}", report.error);

let solution = ferroplan::solve(&domain, &problem, &Options::default())?;
if let Some(plan) = solution.plan {
    for step in &plan.steps {
        println!("{} {}", step.action, step.args.join(" "));
    }
    println!("metric: {:?}", plan.metric);
}
# Ok::<(), ferroplan::SolveError>(())
```

The public, `serde`-serializable surface: **`solve`** (plan a domain+problem),
**`decompose`** (split a too-big temporal goal into validated contracts),
**`parse`** (syntax-check + summarize PDDL without solving),
**`Session`** (ground once, replan many — for a live loop that re-solves the same
world every tick), and **`plan::validate_plan`** (independently check a plan). See
[`examples/`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/crates/ferroplan/examples) for `solve`, `parse`, `json_api`, and
`replan` (`Session` vs. re-solving from scratch, with timings).

## Configuration

Every solver knob lives on one `Options` struct (library-first, `serde`-
serializable). The CLI flags and JSON job options map to the same fields; omitted
JSON fields fall back to the defaults shown.

```rust
ferroplan::solve(&domain, &problem, &ferroplan::Options {
    mode:            Mode::Auto,        // auto | ff | partition | pddl3 | temporal
    search:          Search::Auto,      // auto | ehc | best-first | ehc-then-best-first
    helpful_actions: true,              // helpful-action pruning (EHC)
    weight_g:        1.0,               // best-first path-length weight
    weight_h:        5.0,               // best-first heuristic weight  (1·g + 5·h)
    threads:         0,                 // 0 = auto
    max_evaluated:   None,              // search node cap
    optimize:        true,              // PDDL3: optimize metric vs. satisfice
    ..Default::default()                // every field is optional
})?;
```

CLI equivalents: `--mode`, `--search`, `--no-helpful`, `--weight-g/--weight-h`,
`--max-evaluated`, `--satisfice`, `--threads`. Via JSON:
`{"domain": "...", "problem": "...", "options": {"search": "best-first"}}`.

## Examples

[`examples/`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples) collects worked domains that exercise the full feature set
— see the [examples index](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/examples/README.md) for a feature-by-feature map and a
suggested reading order. Highlights:

- [`rpg`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/rpg) — the clean intro: durative actions with renewable
  (workers) and consumable resources, gather → craft → build.
- [`rpg-world`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/rpg-world) — a ~120-action crafting/economy domain
  (durative actions, numeric resources, renewable capacities, a reachability
  axiom) with a corpus of validated contracts, a flavor-×-scale [`suite/`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/rpg-world/suite),
  an adversarial [`hard/`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/rpg-world/hard) batch, and an
  [industrial-city](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/rpg-world/industrial-city) showcase that runs a whole
  metal/stone/wood industry as a pipeline of contracts.
- [`cabin`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/cabin) — deep numeric build plus a durative "crew" twin
  (makespan vs. crew size, skill-gated scheduling).
- [`reachability`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/reachability) — the worked **derived-axiom**
  (`:derived`) example: static transitive-closure reachability.
- [`village`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/village) — a full-ADL stress test (`when`, `forall`+`when`,
  `or`, negation) over durative + numeric state.
- [`villagers`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/villagers) — a data-driven recipe planner with numeric
  **PDDL3 metric** optimization; the "embed in a game" model.
- [`logistics`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/logistics) — transshipment: per-location goods, trucks
  with capacity, a train line.
- [`jobshop`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/tree/main/examples/jobshop) — scheduling with machine-exclusion (scales to 100
  concurrent jobs).
- [`BORDERS.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/examples/BORDERS.md) — a measured map of where one-shot planning
  solves vs. where a goal must be decomposed into contracts. The **`decompose` API /
  `ff --decompose`** acts on that border: it splits a too-big temporal goal into
  ordered, individually-solved contracts and stitches them into one validated plan
  (e.g. `hard/order-8` → 8 named contracts), falling back to a monolithic solve when
  a goal can't be split.

## Benchmarks

ferroplan measures itself against **three International Planning
Competitions — IPC-5 (2006), IPC-6 (2008), IPC-7 (2011)** — every
deterministic satisficing track, at standard budgets with every plan
VAL-validated. The one honest table per competition (generated by
`benchmarks/standings.py`, refreshed each cut):
[`benchmarks/ipc-standings.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/benchmarks/ipc-standings.md)
— also rendered as the book's
[Standings chapter](https://seanchatmangpt.github.io/ferroplan/standings.html).
Highlights: IPC-5 preference tracks are **reference-scored from the
vendored official archive** — on the qualitative track ferroplan
**beats SGPlan5, the competition winner, 24–10 with 4 ties**,
winning rovers, storage, and tpp outright — and the IPC-7
sequential multi-core track is entered under competition wall-clock
rules.

Classical and ADL coverage/speed are additionally measured against
the C **Metric-FF** over a vendored subset. Headline (native
Metric-FF, EHC default):

| category | ferroplan solved | speed vs Metric-FF |
|---|---:|---|
| STRIPS | 40/40 | 0.71× (~1.4× slower) |
| ADL | 23/24 | 0.77× (~1.3× slower) |
| numeric | 36/40 | 0.22× |

detail: [`benchmarks/results.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/benchmarks/results.md) (and the
[project site](https://seanchatmangpt.github.io/ferroplan)). The comparison oracles are not bundled
(GPL / non-commercial licences) — reproduce per
[`benchmarks/COMPARING.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/benchmarks/COMPARING.md).

**Profiling & perf tracking:** [`PROFILING.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/PROFILING.md) — a deterministic
metrics harness (`benchmarks/perf.py run`/`compare` against a committed baseline,
so improvement/regression is measurable across machines) plus the samply /
flamegraph / criterion-baseline workflow for finding and tracking hotspots.

## Limitations

- **Numeric** trails Metric-FF: EHC's helpful-action lookahead stalls on some
  numeric domains and falls back to (complete, slower) best-first.
- **IPC-5 preferences**: compiled away, then optimized by an **exact-closure
  metric optimizer** with anytime sweeps, a diversified restart ladder, and the
  deterministically-budgeted ESPC penalty loop — all defaults. Coverage is
  **full (48/48)** on the vendored simple-preferences suite and ferroplan
  **leads SGPlan5 under both quality conventions on three of the six domains**
  (openstacks, storage, rovers), with trucks ahead on totals — see the
  [scoreboard](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/benchmarks/ipc5-scoreboard.md). The tpp/pathways p05–p08 tails
  still trail (best-found, flagged *not proven optimal*, measured
  direction-bound); the design record for the remaining work is in
  [`docs/espc-preferences-spec.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/docs/espc-preferences-spec.md) and
  [`docs/roadmap-0.5.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/docs/roadmap-0.5.md).
- **PDDL3 trajectory constraints** (`(:constraints ...)`): the six untimed
  modal operators (`always`, `sometime`, `at-most-once`, `sometime-after`,
  `sometime-before`, `at end`) are **enforced on the classical path** — compiled
  into monitor automata and cross-checked by the independent verifier. Hard
  constraints latch a forced-terminal END action (linear in monitors — the
  0.8 construction; goal-side compilation via `FF_NO_TRAJ_END=1`); soft
  `(preference name ...)` constraints are **priced through the PDDL3 metric
  machinery** like native goal preferences (the IPC-5
  *qualitative-preferences* suite is vendored and scored against the official
  IPC-5 field: ahead of SGPlan5, the track winner, 24W/4T/10L overall,
  winning three of five domains outright — see
  [`benchmarks/ipc5-qualitative-scoreboard.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/benchmarks/ipc5-qualitative-scoreboard.md)).
  The timed operators (`within`, `hold-during`, `hold-after`,
  `always-within`) and the temporal path are still **rejected by name**
  rather than silently dropped (`FF_CONSTRAINTS_REJECT=1` restores the
  pre-0.7 blanket rejection).
- **Temporal**: durative actions with constant, parameter-dependent, or
  state-dependent durations and required concurrency are supported, and **every
  solved plan on the full IPC-2008/2011 tempo-sat corpus is VAL-validated**
  (399/630 at 30 s, 399/399 valid — see
  [`benchmarks/ipc67-temporal.md`](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan/blob/main/benchmarks/ipc67-temporal.md)). Coverage on
  the remainder is search-limited: the recorded walls (machine-shop, storage,
  model-train) are guidance problems, not semantics — and since the 0.14
  extension, `over all` invariants are enforced on every happening, with
  object-symmetry orbits collapsing interchangeable-object state blowups
  (match-cellar 10/20 → 20/20, turn-and-open off zero). Duration
  *inequalities* (`(>= ?duration L)` / `(<= ?duration U)` / `and` ranges) are
  supported — the search commits to the shortest feasible duration — as are
  **timed initial literals** (`(at <time> <literal>)` in `:init`) and
  `?duration` inside numeric effect expressions (duration-dependent effects).
  Continuous (`#t`) effects are not yet supported.
- **Derived predicates** (`:derived`): static/stratified axioms are supported
  (closed into the initial state); *dynamic* derived predicates (bodies over
  changing facts) are not yet.

## Acknowledgments

This project is built in deep respect for the planners that came before it.

**SGPlan** (SGPlan5 / SGPlan6), by Chih-Wei Hsu and Benjamin W. Wah at the
University of Illinois, has been the standard to beat in this corner of automated
planning for the better part of two decades — the IPC-winning system whose
constraint-partitioning and extended-saddle-point penalty-coordination ideas still
define the state of the art for satisficing planning with preferences and with
temporal/resource constraints. I've followed that line of research for many years,
and to build something that even comes *close* to it on a slice of the benchmarks
is, genuinely, an honor. Enormous credit to that team for the depth, rigor, and
sheer durability of the work — ferroplan is in no small part an attempt to learn
from it, in Rust.

Equal thanks to Jörg Hoffmann's **FF / Metric-FF**, whose relaxed-plan heuristic
and enforced hill-climbing are the backbone of this engine; to the IPC organizers
and domain authors whose benchmarks make progress measurable; and to Derek Long and
Maria Fox's **VAL**, used here to independently validate the temporal plans.

Thanks also to **Sean Chatman**, whose downstream
[fork](https://github.com/seanchatmangpt/ferroplan) drives ferroplan as the
deterministic core of a Claude Code agent control plane, and in doing so put
real pressure on the MCP and library surfaces. The optional `schema` feature
(typed JSON Schema for `Options`/`Mode`/`Search` instead of an opaque `Value`)
and the wasm `set_timed_fact` / `world_bytes` / `mind_bytes` bindings came from
that work; his stateful-session MCP server is the design we're measuring our own
against.
