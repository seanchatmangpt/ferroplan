//! PDDL3 trajectory constraints — ENFORCED since 0.7 (docs/roadmap-0.7.md).
//!
//! 0.4.1 pinned that `(:constraints ...)` was cleanly rejected; 0.7 narrows
//! that fence: the six untimed modal operators compile into monitor automata
//! and are ENFORCED on the classical path — hard constraints as goal
//! conjuncts (Phase 1), soft `(preference name ...)` constraints priced
//! through the PDDL3 metric machinery (Phase 2) — while the timed operators,
//! soft constraints on durative domains, and `Session` keep NAMED rejections
//! (hard untimed constraints on durative domains are enforced since 0.23
//! Phase 2 — see tests/temporal_constraints.rs). Each
//! operator gets a bite/no-bite pair on a hand-checkable switch domain, and
//! every solved plan is cross-checked through the independent verifier
//! (`verify::verify` folds the ORIGINAL constraint semantics over its
//! replay — never the compiled monitors).
