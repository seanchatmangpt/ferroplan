//! INCUMBENT ZERO (0.28 Lane I): the PDDL3 optimizer is handed a plan for
//! the HARD goals before it starts, so it can no longer end a run with
//! nothing to report.
//!
//! The defect this closes is a SCALE phenomenon and its RED receipts live on
//! the boards, not here: rovers-preferences-qualitative i9 spends 70k
//! evaluations and a whole 20 s wall in the compiled task without reaching
//! the hard goal once, while the classical ladder reaches it in 133
//! evaluations and 30 ms -- `metric_optimize` returned `None`, the row read
//! "unsolved", and 46 of `ipc5-qual-pref`'s 49 misses at 60 s were that
//! shape. At fixture scale the compiled search always finds SOMETHING, so
//! what is pinned here is the mechanism the fix rests on: the lift from the
//! original task's plan into the compiled task, through the two places the
//! op sets differ (precondition-preference VARIANTS, and the trajectory
//! gate's synthetic TRAJ-END), and the floor's price.
