//! A BANKED ROW MUST CROSS THE WIRE (0.28 Lane S). The complex-preference
//! tiers bank a plan with every preference dropped, then chase quality with
//! every preference hardened. Until 0.28 the chase was charged to the same
//! wall as the plan it was trying to improve: it ran to the deadline, the
//! ladder under it opened further rungs past the deadline, and the caller
//! then grounded the original pair AGAIN to score the result. The board's
//! runner kills at the wall, so the row read "unsolved" with a valid plan
//! in memory -- pathways-preferences-complex i7 returned its banked,
//! VAL-valid plan at 21.94 s against a 20 s wall, and 24 of that domain's
//! 30 rows were lost the same way.
//!
//! The fixture is tests/tsearch_wall.rs's ring with the unreachable
//! full-ring goal moved into a PREFERENCE. The hard goal is empty, so the
//! banked plan is the empty plan; the hardened chase can never succeed
//! (the last end around the ring always knocks a bit off) and never
//! exhausts at fixture scale. Only the wall ends it -- and the pin is that
//! it ends INSIDE the wall, with the banked plan reported AND scored.
//!
//! The BALLAST is what makes the old shape RED rather than merely tight:
//! a three-parameter action behind a fact nothing can ever add. The solve
//! side prunes it, but every grounding still has to enumerate its K^3
//! bindings, so grounding costs real time -- which is the corpus shape
//! (pathways-complex i20 grounds for ~12 s). v0.27.1 on this fixture:
//! returned at 3.99 s against a 3 s wall, the overrun being the scorer's
//! grounding, paid after the chase had already spent the wall.
//!
//! The wall is 8 s and the ballast modest on purpose: the reserve being
//! pinned is half a second at this scale, and the first cut of this fixture
//! (6 s, a heavier ballast) read 6.118 s once with a game running on the
//! box. A wall pin has to hold on a machine that is doing something else.
//!
//! Child processes per scenario (the tests/tground_wall.rs convention: the
//! wall clock is a process-global OnceLock).
