//! PDDL3 trajectory constraints on DURATIVE domains — enforced since 0.23
//! Phase 2 (docs/roadmap-0.23.md).
//!
//! RED, recorded before the change (0.22.0 + cd645f1, this worktree): every
//! problem below — including the EMPTY `(and)` block — died at the one gate
//! (constraints.rs `gate()`) with the blanket
//! "trajectory constraints on durative-action (temporal) domains are not
//! yet enforced" rejection, exit 1; so did storage-time-constraints i1,
//! tpp-metric-time-constraints i1/i2, and trucks-time-constraints i1 on the
//! baseline binary. GREEN: the untimed operators now compile onto the
//! snap-compiled task (monitor `When`s riding every happening; the at-end
//! fold as a transition-free `TRAJ-END` latch), while the timed operators
//! and soft (preference) constraints keep NAMED rejections.
//!
//! The oracle everywhere is `temporal::validate`, which since this phase
//! folds the ORIGINAL constraint semantics over its replay — independent of
//! the compiled monitors, the verify.rs convention. On the boards the
//! referee is external VAL (constraints enforced natively).
