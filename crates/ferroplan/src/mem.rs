//! MEMORY IS A WALL TOO (0.28 Lane M).
//!
//! The engine has always had a memory MODEL -- bytes per node times nodes,
//! against 60 % of whatever budget the environment declares
//! (`search::rlimit_budget`). It has never had a memory MEASUREMENT, and the
//! model is the thing this project keeps recording as wrong for exactly the
//! classes that matter: `storage-preferences-complex` growing to 528 GB of
//! address space under a declared 6 GB, the `mem-cap` rows that die 3-10 s
//! into a 60 s wall with the runner's RSS watchdog, never the engine, doing
//! the killing.
//!
//! What made that urgent is the rest of 0.28: those lanes put a valid plan in
//! hand EARLY and then go on working -- a quality chase, a bigger task to
//! ground so the plan can be priced and improved. The first board read through
//! the crucible (6 GB a run, where the hand-rolled sit had allowed 8) lost
//! fifteen rows the sit had solved, every one `mem-cap`, every one with its
//! plan already found: the watchdog killed the process in the middle of the
//! OPTIONAL work and the plan went with it. Dying of memory with a plan in
//! hand is the same sin as dying of the wall with one, and it gets the same
//! cure: the budget is read at the checkpoints that already exist, a trip is
//! an honest capped return, and whatever was banked is what comes back.
//!
//! BOUNDED WORK ONLY ([`MemWall::arm`]). A first search has nothing to fall
//! back on, and a wall that stopped it at 4.5 GB of a 6 GB budget would take
//! the solve it was 1 GB from: over the record, one run in ten peaks above
//! 4.4 GB. So the wall arms only inside a `search::ScopedDeadline` -- the
//! quality chase, the grounding that prices a plan already found, a rung's
//! bet -- where a trip costs an improvement and never a row.
//!
//! RESIDENT bytes, because that is what the runner's watchdog measures
//! (Darwin refuses every `setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS)`, so resident is the only
//! budget it can enforce). Read from the kernel directly: `/proc/self/status`
//! on Linux, `task_info` on macOS -- declared by hand, because this crate
//! takes no `libc` dependency and `std` already links the symbols. Anywhere
//! else (wasm included) there is no reading and no trip, and the engine is
//! exactly what it was.
