//! PDDL3 trajectory-constraint ENFORCEMENT (0.7, docs/roadmap-0.7.md).
//!
//! 0.4.1 through 0.6, every `(:constraints ...)` block got parsed and then
//! shot down clean. 0.7 cuts a narrower fence, operator by operator: the
//! six untimed modal operators (`always`, `sometime`, `at-most-once`,
//! `sometime-after`, `sometime-before`, `at end`) compile down into small
//! **monitor automata** riding the state trajectory — fresh 0-ary monitor
//! facts flipped by `Effect::When` conditional effects welded onto every
//! real action (the grounder and heuristic already know how to eat this).
//! A HARD constraint's acceptance rides into the goal, conjoined; a SOFT
//! `(preference name ...)` constraint (Phase 2) becomes a goal-side
//! `(preference name <acceptance>)`, priced by the PDDL3 metric machinery
//! like any native goal preference. Anything this build cannot enforce
//! (`hold-during` / `hold-after`; timed operators on a clockless CLASSICAL
//! domain; a soft constraint on a temporal domain) keeps a rejection that
//! NAMES the operator — the "never silently ignore" contract is narrowed,
//! never deleted.
//!
//! THE TIMED OPERATORS (0.24 Phase 4 — stage c, docs/roadmap-0.24.md):
//! `within t φ` and `always-within t φ ψ` lower to the SAME monitor shapes
//! via one new ingredient — the search-maintained clock fluent
//! `CLOCK_FLUENT`, stamped with the decision-epoch time into every state
//! the temporal search creates. A state's clock is the time it BEGAN, and a
//! monitor `When` reads its SOURCE state, so `(<= (TRAJ-CLOCK) t)` inside a
//! transition condition tests exactly "the observed state sits inside the
//! deadline". `within` is `sometime` with the SEEN transition
//! deadline-gated plus a VIOL transition when the window closes unseen;
//! `always-within` is `sometime-after` with a per-monitor `TRAJ{i}-DUE`
//! fluent assigned `clock + t` at each trigger (a conditional numeric
//! effect — machinery the grounder already owns) and a VIOL transition when
//! the clock passes DUE while the obligation is open. Both VIOL facts are
//! permanent by construction (the clock never decreases), so the 0.23
//! birth-prune and zombie checks apply unchanged. Only `compile_timed`
//! (the temporal path) accepts them: emitted-schedule ε-shifts are refereed
//! by `temporal`'s monitor audit, which re-stamps the clock from EMITTED
//! times — the times VAL reads.
//!
//! THE TEMPORAL PATH (0.23 Phase 2, docs/roadmap-0.23.md): hard untimed
//! constraints on a durative-action domain are enforced by the SAME compile,
//! applied to the snap-compiled classical task instead of the lifted
//! durative one — [`gate`] vets and passes the pair through, and the
//! temporal solve path calls [`compile`] after `temporal::compile` splits
//! every durative action into snap actions. Monitor `When`s then ride every
//! happening (start snaps, end snaps, TIL appliers), so the source-state
//! observation ladder below covers the decision-epoch trajectory exactly;
//! `TRAJ-END` grounds as an ordinary instantaneous classical op the search
//! fires last (every real op requires `TRAJ-PLANNING`), and the plan
//! reconstruction drops it — ε-separation and every downstream consumer
//! only ever see real steps. An `(at end φ)` hard constraint lowers to a
//! transition-free ACC latch, which keeps the goal literal-only — the 0.8
//! motivation verbatim, and mandatory here because the temporal grounding
//! entries (`ground_stratified` and its 0.23 walled solve-side twin) do
//! not run the 0.22 factored-goal
//! compilation, so a goal-side disjunctive fold would re-open the
//! REACH-GOAL DNF product this module's history warns about. Because the
//! ε-repair may permute same-slot happenings AFTER the search certified the
//! monitors on ITS order, the emitted schedule is re-audited monitor-side
//! before a constrained plan is returned (`temporal`'s monitor audit;
//! red ⇒ the search continues instead of shipping a VAL-red plan).
//!
//! THE OBSERVATION OFFSET (load-bearing): `PackedTask::apply` reads
//! conditional-effect conditions off the SOURCE state, so a monitor riding
//! action a_k is watching S_{k-1}, one step behind. The trajectory
//! S_0..S_n gets covered three ways — S_0 by compile-time evaluation
//! against init (this module), S_0..S_{n-1} by the per-action `When`s, and
//! S_n by the END construction below (0.8) or a goal-side formula
//! (`FF_NO_TRAJ_END=1`, the 0.7 shape). For `sometime-before` that one-step
//! lag is exactly what gives "strictly earlier" its teeth. Every
//! transition condition on one monitor fact stays mutually exclusive, so
//! the add-wins conflict rule can never co-fire a set and a clear on the
//! same bit.
//!
//! THE END CONSTRUCTION (0.8, docs/roadmap-0.8.md Phase 1): a HARD
//! monitor's S_n acceptance check used to ride into the goal conjoined,
//! and several operators throw disjunctions into that mix — the grounder
//! compiles a disjunctive goal into one synthetic REACH-GOAL operator per
//! DNF disjunct, EXPONENTIAL in the monitor count (storage hard fixture:
//! 3^10 = 59,049 ops, docs/roadmap-0.7.md Phase 1, on record). Since 0.8
//! the acceptance rides a forced-terminal synthetic action instead: every
//! real action needs the init-true phase fact `TRAJ-PLANNING` standing;
//! one synthetic 0-ary action `TRAJ-END` strikes it, raises `TRAJ-ENDED`,
//! and carries one `Effect::When` latch per hard monitor (condition = that
//! monitor's acceptance over its bits plus the S_n body, add =
//! `TRAJ{i}-ACC`). Because `When` conditions read the SOURCE state,
//! `TRAJ-END` firing after the last real action is watching exactly S_n.
//! The compiled goal comes out all positive literals — original goal ∧
//! `TRAJ-ENDED` ∧ the ACC facts — so the goal-DNF product never fires
//! again: cost runs LINEAR in monitors (2-3 conditional latches each, on
//! ONE op). SOFT acceptance doesn't move: `(preference name <acc>)`
//! wrappers stay parked in the goal with their S_n bodies intact — they're
//! invisible to the classical grounder's DNF, and the whole PDDL3 metric
//! stack keeps pricing them exactly as before, which is why the 0.7
//! deferral risk simply dissolves. The synthetic `TRAJ-END` step gets
//! stripped from every reported plan by the callers who ran this gate —
//! planner/api filter it by display name, conditionally, never touching
//! the constraint-free path.
//!
//! The independent verifier stays clear of this compilation entirely:
//! `verify.rs` folds the ORIGINAL constraint semantics over its own replay
//! (see [`Fold`]), so the oracle never depends on the compiled monitors.
