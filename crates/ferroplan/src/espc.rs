//! ESPC — Extended Saddle-Point Condition, the penalty-resolution outer
//! loop.
//!
//! SGPlan's defining move laid on top of Metric-FF (Wah & Chen; Hsu, Wah,
//! Huang & Chen, IPC-2006): pull cross-partition and global constraints
//! into line with a **finite penalty-update loop** — re-solve under fixed
//! penalties, raise the penalty on whatever's still violated, converge on
//! an *extended saddle point* (a constrained local minimum), and keep the
//! best plan standing as an anytime incumbent the whole way through. See
//! docs/sgplan6-spec.md §4 and ferroplan/docs/espc-preferences-spec.md.
//!
//! Here the "global constraint" is the openstacks make/start coordination:
//! a once-only conditional achievement (`make-product`) firing while its
//! enabling orders are still `waiting` burns the delivery preference for
//! good. The delete-relaxed RPG can't see this coming — it can re-add the
//! deliverable in its own blind spot — so the penalty gets read off the
//! CONCRETE state instead (see
//! [`crate::search::SatGuidance::deadline`]). The loop runs a
//! **per-trigger** penalty `λ[M]`, raising it only on the products whose
//! deliveries actually got missed — auto-tuned per instance, something no
//! single fixed penalty (the Phase-0 `FF_DEADLINE_WEIGHT` lever) can pull
//! off. Penalty multipliers stay SEPARATE from preference weights: weights
//! compute the reported metric, λ only reshuffles the search order — never
//! touches legality, never touches the metric itself.
//!
//! Anytime plus monotone-ascent: λ never backs down, but the plan handed
//! back is the best seen across every iteration — so an overshooting λ can
//! never drag the result backward.
