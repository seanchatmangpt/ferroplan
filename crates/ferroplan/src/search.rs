//! FIELD LOG: data-parallel weighted best-first sweep.
//!
//! Every round, the swarm surfaces one batch of the lowest-cost contacts,
//! cracks them open, spawns every legal successor, scrubs the duplicates
//! against what's already been walked, then runs the FF heuristic across
//! the whole batch AT ONCE — every worker screaming in parallel, the one
//! real cost center in the whole operation. `par_map` never breaks
//! sequence and control never leaves the one thread, so the recovered
//! plan is bit-identical no matter how many hands touch it. Only the
//! clock on the wall moves.
