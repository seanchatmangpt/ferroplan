//! Goal-respecting object-symmetry orbits (0.14 ext Phase 10) — the lever
//! the 0.13 TMS autopsy called for: temporal-machine-shop was flatlining
//! 0/20 because interchangeable pieces, told apart ONLY by which
//! `(baked-structure p q)` goal pair they happen to be serving, turn every
//! subset-assignment of "which identical piece is baking" into its own
//! distinct visited state — the state space bloats on a distinction that
//! never mattered.
//!
//! The cut: find orbits of interchangeable MEMBER UNITS — single objects,
//! or the goal-pair tuples the TMS shape throws up — then canonicalize
//! every visited key under member relabeling. States that differ only by
//! swapping interchangeable members collapse down to one representative.
//! Plans stay concrete on the way out; only the visited space shrinks.
//!
//! Grounded machinery: every fact/op/fluent display that touches an orbit
//! object gets pulled into a FAMILY — displays sharing one (head,
//! literal/slot pattern), held as a dense table over member coordinates.
//! A member permutation σ then walks the whole grounded task by table
//! lookup, so facts COUPLING several members (TMS grounds `(assemble p
//! q)` across every cross-pair combination) permute in step with the
//! per-member ones instead of breaking the orbit apart.
//!
//! Soundness by construction, conservative at every checkpoint:
//!
//! - Candidate members need matching init profiles (statics and fluents
//!   both), no literal appearance in any action schema, and a clean
//!   per-family CLOSURE check: within each equality-pattern class of
//!   member coordinates, cells are uniformly present or uniformly absent
//!   — i.e. the grounded task really is closed under every member
//!   transposition. Any violation drops detection entirely.
//! - Goal facts must be per-member and shared by every member of their
//!   orbit (the goal SET is then σ-invariant); numeric goals over touched
//!   fluents, TILs, derived rules, PDDL3 constraints, and non-total-time
//!   metrics all bail — each could distinguish members invisibly.
//! - The canonical form σ(s) is a pure function of the state, chosen by
//!   sorting per-member signatures, so determinism and t1 ≡ t8 hold. Any
//!   σ is sound: canon(s1) = canon(s2) implies s2 = σ2⁻¹σ1(s1), a true
//!   automorphism image (ties may MISS merges, never mis-merge).
//! - Applied to VISITED KEYS only — the temporal key (state bits,
//!   relevant fluent values, and the pending-end agenda's op ids all
//!   permute together) since 0.14 ext, and the CLASSICAL keys since 0.22
//!   Phase 6 ([`OrbitMap::canonical_skey`]: optimal mode's
//!   visited/closed/best_g sites and the satisficing dedup in the
//!   parallel successor phase). Nodes stay CONCRETE everywhere, so plan
//!   extraction and VAL are untouched. Callers must pass a σ-invariant
//!   `forbidden` mask (the CLI passes none; Session/tresolve pass no
//!   orbit at all — recorded decision).
//! - A non-total-time metric bails UNLESS it is the classical
//!   single-fluent `minimize` shape AND every op family's constant costs
//!   are uniform within each equality class (the 0.22 Phase 6 L2 gate —
//!   the soundness trap is merging quality-distinct states, so any cost
//!   the gate cannot certify as a symmetric constant drops detection).
//!
//! `FF_NO_ORBIT=1` disables detection entirely;
//! `FF_NO_ORBIT_CLASSICAL=1` kills only the classical consumer
//! ([`detect_classical`]) while the temporal one keeps its orbit.
//!
//! **The goal-isomorphism arm (0.23 Phase 4 probe 1, `FF_ORBIT_ISO=1`,
//! default OFF):** detection extends from goal-σ-INVARIANCE to
//! goal-ISOMORPHISM — units form GOAL-BLIND (type + init profile only,
//! the goal never splits an orbit), and each goal atom touching an orbit
//! becomes a DESIGNATION (family + member coords) instead of an
//! invariance obligation. σ then acts jointly on objects and goal atoms:
//! canonicalization merges states across the full goal-blind group, and
//! the goal test relaxes to "some σ maps this state onto the goal"
//! ([`OrbitMap::iso_goal_witness`], an exact designation-matching search
//! that returns the WITNESS permutation). Consumers wired for the arm
//! (the temporal search, optimal A*) apply the witness to the emitted
//! plan through the op family tables ([`OrbitMap::iso_remap_op`]), so
//! the plan that reaches σ(goal) is emitted as its σ-image serving the
//! ORIGINAL goal — sound because equal init profiles force σ(init) =
//! init (see the round-trip fixtures). Pruning stays complete because a
//! merged state's every reachable goal image is still recognized by the
//! relaxed test; optimal mode keeps its certificate by weakening h to
//! the σ-invariant goal part (admissible for every σ-image). Consumers
//! NOT wired for the relaxed test never receive an iso map
//! ([`detect_classical`] stays strict by construction).
//!
//! Probe verdict, recorded at the probe (the 0.23 roadmap's
//! pre-registered reads): TMS-2011 i1 FAILED both halves — the
//! goal-blind orbits form exactly as designed ([10, 15, 25] pieces, 25
//! designations live) but the distinct-visited-class collapse reads
//! 1.27× at the 60k eval budget (11,114 → 8,780; ≥10× pre-registered)
//! and best_h sits at the 110 stock floor at 15k/30k/60k, BOTH arms —
//! the 0.14 pair orbits had already banked the group's cheap coset, and
//! the plateau is start-epoch choreography, exactly what the 0.22
//! agenda-doom receipts predicted. The TEMPORAL constituency records
//! DEAD; the arm is CLASSICAL-ONLY (opt-in, default-off), refereed on
//! the goal-paired classical shapes — child-snack stays INERT by
//! construction (uniform unary designations are σ-invariant already,
//! so its residue is out of this lever's reach and its optimal h is
//! untouched).
