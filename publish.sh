# publish.sh — release the four crates.io crates (ferroplan-sat first, since
# 0.24.0 the library's own dependency; then the library; then the CLI and MCP
# server, which depend on the library), then cut the matching GitHub Release
# (title + body sourced straight from CHANGELOG.md — never hand-copied, so it
# can't drift).
#
# Run from your OWN machine after `cargo login <token>` (the sandbox this was
# authored in has no crates.io token and the network blocks crates.io, so it
# can't publish — only you can). Everything here is the RELEASING.md pre-flight
# plus the two `cargo publish` calls, in the required order, plus the GitHub
# Release (needs the `gh` CLI — https://cli.github.com/, `gh auth login` once).
#
# Usage:
#   ./publish.sh                    # pre-flight, confirm, publish, tag, GitHub Release
#   ./publish.sh --dry-run          # pre-flight + `cargo publish --dry-run` only, no upload
#   ./publish.sh --yes              # skip the confirmation prompt
#   ./publish.sh --release-only     # skip crates.io/tagging entirely — just cut/update the
#                                    # GitHub Release for a version that's ALREADY tagged
#                                    # (the tag must already exist locally or on origin).
#   ./publish.sh --release-only 0.2.2   # ...for a specific (e.g. historical/backfill) version
