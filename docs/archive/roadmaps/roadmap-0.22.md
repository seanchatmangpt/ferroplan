# ferroplan 0.22 roadmap — the coverage cycle

Scoped 2026-08-05, the day after the 0.21.0 cut, by direct request:
**improve solving coverage — think big.** The scoping ran as a fresh
per-domain decode of all thirteen promoted boards (the first cycle
whose raws carry a clean same-box A/B against both 0.20 and the
v0.19/v0.18 backfills), plus five deep design reads on the
deferred-ledger bets. The decode reproduces the standings to the row:
1,923 unsolved = 1,891 timeout + 16 mem-cap + 14 early-exit + 1
VAL-RED + 1 adjudicated engine-reject. Timeouts are 98% of the
failure mass. The ledger is a pure guidance-and-allocation ledger
now, and the classes 0.19–0.21 built machinery for are almost all
EMPTY — which is what "think big" gets to build on.

Four numbers order the cycle, largest honest pot first:

- **645 distinct classical-satisficing timeout instances** (734 rows
  across six boards) — the centerpiece deferred at 0.20 AND 0.21,
  carrying the field's recipe by name since the IPC-2026 results
  landed. Wall-shaped, not budget-starved: every one of the 300 s
  entry's 89 timeouts also times out at 60 s, and 5× budget converts
  19 of 108.
- **503 optimal-proof timeouts, single-class** — the ENTIRE failure
  mass of all three proof boards is hard wall kills with empty notes;
  the largest single-mechanism pot on the books, and 0.21's root gate
  just proved the mechanism moves (LM-cut certificates 13 → 56).
- **344 temporal failures**, of which the 110-instance three-domain
  zero block (storage 0/40, TMS 0/40, model-train 0/30) is now THREE
  RELEASES DEEP and EIGHT mechanism-precise negatives deep — this
  scoping ran the last two cheap levers and killed both (below).
  Temporal mechanism work is honestly deferred again, with 0.23
  pre-scoped rather than waved at.
- **318 numeric-satisficing timeouts** across the two numeric boards,
  now attributed family-by-family (the sitting 0.21 parked ran this
  scoping): a 139-instance PLATEAU POOL that is the numeric face of
  the same partitioned-novelty recipe as the classical centerpiece,
  plus 2048's grounding pathology, plus a wall-honesty hole with
  receipts.

And the gate that is not a pot: **markettrader i3 is the only VAL-RED
row on 4,076** — new at 0.21, on a domain VAL ingests fine: the
engine claimed a 453-step plan in 4.87 s and VAL rejected it. Phase 1
opens with it, because a scoreboard with an unexplained rejected plan
on it outranks every coverage number on this page.

Two cross-cutting facts the phases lean on:

- **A quarter of all failures sits in five named families** —
  transport 148, floor-tile 119, parking 88, openstacks 84,
  child-snack 44 — each spanning three to seven boards, so a
  domain-shaped win pays out several boards at once.
- **The wall is being silently overrun.** The armed `FF_TIME_LIMIT`
  is enforced only at eval-count checkpoints and rung boundaries, so
  slow-eval domains run to 67–76 s of a 60 s budget (solo receipts:
  2048 at 67–74 s — grounding never checks the clock at all —
  gear-car 72.1 s, block-grouping 76 s), and coverage is sitting just
  past the line: onlycraft-sat i7 solves at 60.2 s, gear-car i6 at
  72.1 s. The boards are honest (the runner kills at 60); the ENGINE
  is not spending the wall it was given — it is spending somebody
  else's.

Field refresh: reused from 0.21's, four days old — the answer key
(Panino's partitioned numeric novelty, Count Downward's numeric
PDBs/CEGAR, LNP-optimal nearly open at 83/260) is unchanged, and the
comparability column landed at the 0.21 cut. One correction from this
decode: the deferred ledger's "2018 wall (136)" does not reproduce
from either the 0.20 or 0.21 raws; the fresh anchor is **167 timeouts
on 2018, 150 of them search-shaped** (organic-synthesis's 17+3 are
grounding). And one hygiene note carried loudly: only 6 of the 13
air21 boards have `conditions.json` files on disk — the "all 13
verdict clean" claim in the release record rests on the driver's
retry discipline for the other seven; 0.22's driver writes conditions
for EVERY board, no exceptions.

## Phase 1 — the gate and the bill (fixtures before levers)

Nothing in this phase is a coverage lever. All of it is the
discipline that makes the levers safe to pull.

- **The VAL-RED, decoded by hand first.** markettrader i3: reproduce
  solo, diff the plan against VAL's complaint step by step. Engine
  bug ⇒ it becomes THE phase (a satisficing planner that emits one
  unsound plan cannot be trusted on 2,152 others); VAL-config or
  domain subtlety ⇒ adjudicated like settlersnumeric i7 was, on the
  record. No numeric work lands before this verdict.
- **The charge's bill, pinned.** 0.21's numeric-precondition charge
  bought +43 and cost 8, all eight named: ext-plant-watering i7
  (was 0.15 s!) and i13, counters i12/i16, delivery i18/i19, rover
  i19, zenotravel i20 — all former fast solves, now timeouts. The
  loudest (ext-plant-watering i7) becomes a charge-regression
  fixture BEFORE any new heuristic work; the decode then chooses:
  charge damping (the gradient distortion shape lever a2's design
  already carries), or the honest per-domain record of the trade.
  The −8 is this cycle's opening debt.
- **block-grouping's pre-search hang, instrumented.** i3 hangs 76 s
  under a THREE-eval think budget — before or at search entry, and
  partition mode emits no `FF_WALL_DEBUG` narration at all
  (partition.rs is silent; every other driver narrates). Instrument
  first, then decode where i3 sits. Field is 20/20 here; 18
  instances ride on this answer.
- Bookkeeping riders: expedition is verbatim on BOTH numeric boards
  (scope once, bank twice — the referee tables must not double-count
  it); flashfill i10 closes as converted-by-0.21 (solves on the
  board at 30.7 s); parking-2011's docket entry stays open (12/20
  now, frontier at 47 s).

### Recorded — the gate passes, the bill is paid, the balloon pops honestly

- **The VAL-RED is NOT ours.** VAL refuses markettrader's INSTANCE
  before reading any plan: `Type-checking initial state failed` —
  the instance files init `fuel`/`fuel-used` fluents a commented-out
  metric left undeclared. The 453-step plan hand-replays at exact
  floats with zero violations (final cash 1001.3000000000025 ≥
  1000); a fuel-stripped copy gets `Plan valid`. Adjudicated like
  settlersnumeric i7 before it. The harness learned BOTH typecheck
  refusal signatures (from Validate's own main.cpp),
  val-availability.py re-probed all 216 domains, and markettrader is
  the map's one new row — the VAL-RED class zeroes with no board
  edits, and val-availability.py's dead hardcoded paths got fixed in
  passing.
- **The bill is paid with a SUM, and MAX is the probed negative.**
  The charge's damping is per-achiever gap SUM plus skipping
  preconditions an already-selected op moves toward satisfaction;
  `FF_NUMPRE_NODAMP=1` restores 0.21 exactly. MAX-damping was built
  first and measured: it recovered i7 but traded five 0.21 near-wall
  solves — replaced, recorded. Recovered on a quiet box: the named
  ext-plant-watering i7 (2.94M evals unsolved → 354 steps at 859,772
  evals) and i13, delivery i18/i19 at the hatch's EXACT eval counts,
  rover i19 — plus 2–8× wall margins on i4/i5/i6/i8. Held
  byte-identical: sailing i1 (174/29,203), pathwaysmetric i1
  (12/4,710), tpp i1. Re-attributed OFF the bill: counters i12/i16
  and zenotravel i20 — the hatch no longer recovers them, so
  something else in 0.21 moved them; the old-binary column at the
  cut owns the answer.
- **block-grouping's hang, decoded to arithmetic:** i3's 21
  disjunctive coordinate-Eq or-goals DNF-multiply to 4^21 conjuncts
  inside `and_merge` (2172/2172 stack samples; the board's own
  shape: i1 at 4 ors solves, i13's 257 ors mem-cap in 3.8 s).
  Grounding now holds a BUDGET (wall + declared-byte arms,
  `Grounded::Budget`): i3's 76 s balloon becomes a 7.8 s honest
  exit that names itself and never says "unsolvable"; partition
  mode narrates under `FF_WALL_DEBUG` at last. The CONVERSION lever
  (a factored goal-check compilation, ~100 synthetic ops vs 4^21)
  is sized and handed to Phase 7.
- Suite 252/0 in-worktree and after merge; +4 pins including the
  damped-charge unit pair and the goal-DNF budget battery.

## Phase 2 — the honest wall (spend it, all of it, and no more)

0.20 taught the engine to spend the whole wall; 0.21 denominated the
rungs in it; the decode says the remaining hole is that the clock is
CHECKED in evals, and grounding never checks it at all. Slow-eval
domains overrun to 67–76 s and get killed holding work; fast-eval
domains near the line lose solves the engine had time for.

- **Lever 1: time-based checkpoints.** Wall checks every K ms
  (clocked, not counted) in every rung's loop — the eval-count
  cadence stays as the fast path, the clock catches the slow-eval
  case. Grounding gets a wall check (2048's 67–74 s overruns are
  grounding, and Phase 7 wants an honest failure there, not a
  zombie).
- **Lever 2: the sailing-wind node cap.** 9 early-exit rows die at
  the 4.08M-node cap with 20–40 s of wall LEFT — post-fold numeric
  nodes are small, and the byte model should be letting these rows
  spend their remainder. Raise-by-model, or refill re-entry with a
  raised cap; the 0.20 refill loop is the pattern.
- **Referee:** the near-wall converts pot (42 instances whose solves
  or kills sit within seconds of the line) plus the boundary-sliver
  churn domains (turn-and-open oscillates 26.2–28.6 s of a 30 s
  wall on BOTH temporal boards). Band: +6–15, and a cleaner
  instrument for every phase behind it. No armed budget ⇒
  byte-identical, as always.

### Recorded — every overrun ends by ~61 s, and one converts (with 5A)

- **The named receipts, re-run:** 2048 i8 67.2 s zombie → 60.6 s
  honest exit; sailing-wind-sat i0 73.9 → 60.7 s capped;
  sailing-wind-opt i9's 90–120 s external kills → 59.3 s honest
  inconclusive (conversion NOT achieved at 13.1M expansions — the
  recorded negative — and a model finding banked: the sat byte
  model overcharges ~2× there). And one conversion already:
  **gear-car i6 SOLVES at 57.8 s inside the wall** (LAMA slice →
  novelty slice → best-first round 1), a candidate board +1.
- **5A landed with a design upgrade the receipts forced:** a flat
  LAMA fraction provably loses hiking i6 (its board solve spends
  ~43 s in the LAMA rung), so the slice is PROGRESS-CONDITIONAL —
  half-tranche extensions while best-h/landmark-count improve, hard
  checkpoint backstop. tetris i4 converts via the novelty rung on a
  quiet box ('wall: solved by novelty'); at load the 0.30 default is
  marginal (0.5 converts loaded) — the sweep referees the knob.
- **Beyond the spec's letter, to actually deliver "end by 61":** a
  teardown/report reserve (stored-bytes-scaled; a ~13 s arena drop
  was measured on sailing i9) in astar and search_from, and astar's
  deadline moved to every-pop (the count cadence went blind inside
  the memory compressor). Grounding's wall check arms only on plain
  solve entries — validator/session/temporal always finish
  grounding a found plan.
- **Casualty watch clean:** tidybot-2011 i18/i19 and
  openstacks-2011 i16 — unsolved both ways (no further ground
  lost), now honest ~60 s exits instead of 90 s external kills.
- **An integration seam worth its line:** both Wave-1 builders
  independently invented a grounding budget exit; the merge unified
  them on `Grounded::Budget(String)` (P1's wall+byte arms carrying
  P2's enumeration trip as its message), one seam pin re-worded,
  252/0 integrated.

## Phase 3 — the optimal ladder, third lesson (allocation, then resumption)

0.21's root gate turned LM-cut from 13 certificates into 56 and took
seq-opt to 275/550 — and the same-box A/B names, per instance, what
it cost and what it left: 12 losses vs 0.20, ten of them h^max
certificates killed by the unconditional 24 s sprint slice; city-car
−6 vs v0.19 on thin gate margins; and every one of the 53 LM-cut
certificates on 2008/11 paid the full 24 s sprint before LM-cut got
its first node, with three certs landing within 1.7 s of the wall.
The gate was right; the SLICE is still denominated wrong. Levers,
smallest first, each with its own receipt:

- **Lever 1 — the margin b-flip (+7 receipted):** the gate is binary
  (`lc > hm`, optimal.rs:603); city-car's six v0.19 proofs gate
  c-branch at ratios 1.09–1.36 while every probed TRUE-c domain sits
  at 2.2–6.0. b-branch below ratio ~1.4: recovers city-car ×6
  (i8 re-proven solo, cost 76) + tetris i5. Referee: 2014-opt ≥ 64,
  the v0.19 column, exactly what the release record demanded.
- **Lever 2 — margin-scaled sprint slice (+4–12):** at ratio ≥ 2 the
  landmark structure is unambiguous — scale the sprint fraction down
  (~0.1) and give LM-cut the wall it keeps almost-missing with
  (min cert 24.12 s, median 27.7 s, three within 1.7 s of the kill
  line).
- **Lever 3 — sprint-resume (+11 named instances):** the ten lost
  h^max certs have root ratios 2.59–3.5 — INSIDE the true-c range,
  so no threshold saves them; they need the h^max seconds the ladder
  currently throws away at handover. Keep the sprint's A* state;
  LM-cut gets a bounded probe slice; on LM-cut failure h^max RESUMES
  its open list with the leftover wall. This is the one lever with
  new machinery; it lands behind the other two.
- **The instrument repair that gates all three:**
  `opt-differential.py` runs at 90 s and books timeouts as
  "inconclusive, not failures" — which is how ten dying certificates
  sailed through an all-306-recertify gate at 0.21. The differential
  gains a board-budget mode: a certificate that cannot re-certify at
  60 s is a REGRESSION, named per instance. This lands FIRST and
  re-runs against 0.21.0 to establish the honest baseline.
- Band for the phase: +20–30 across the two classical proof boards.
  Incremental LM-cut graduates from the deferred list to a LIVE
  candidate the moment lever 2's boards show LM-cut
  running-and-near-missing as the dominant residue — the three
  near-wall certs say it is close.

### Recorded — margin, allocation, resumption (quiet-box reads at the cut)

- **The instrument first, and it convicted the baseline:** the
  differential's --board-budget mode found 11 of the 12 named
  slice-loss certificates REGRESSION at 60 s board conditions on the
  Wave-1 binary (elevator i12 re-certifies 0.91 s from the kill) —
  the blind spot repaired and immediately load-bearing.
- **All three levers landed** (FF_OPT_GATE_MARGIN 1.4,
  FF_OPT_SPRINT_FRAC_HI 0.1 at ratio ≥ 2, sprint-resume with a
  bounded LM-cut probe at FF_OPT_LMCUT_PROBE_FRAC 0.33 and
  FF_NO_OPT_RESUME's restore hatch beyond the spec's list). Receipts:
  scanalyzer-08 i4 PROVEN cost 24 at 6.0 s vs the 23.2 s baseline;
  rainbowttles-opt i21 narrates the full gate→probe→resume flow;
  city-car i8 gates b-branch at ratio 1.36 exactly as the A/B priced
  (its full quiet-box proof rides the gate batch).
- **Phase 4 landed fail-closed:** the layer bound pinned at
  GoalAt(60) EXACTLY on the pump fixture (61 would be inadmissible,
  59 a silent weakening); the audit's teeth pinned (a scale-up shape
  WOULD have certified PROVEN UNSOLVABLE if armed);
  **sailing-wind-opt i8 PROVEN cost 15 by h^max+numRPG at 132,018
  expansions vs 2.86M blind — 21.7× fewer, in 3.0 s**; onlycraft i3
  the pre-priced honest zero (num root 6, still node-caps);
  trader-cycle re-scoped mid-flight when its premise measured false —
  the lap CERTIFIES cheaply, so the control now pins the certificate
  UNBENT under the arm.
- **The probe tax is real and named:** mid-class h^max certs land
  ~18–30 s later under the 0.1-class sprint + probe; elevator i12's
  59 s LM-cut cert structurally cannot fit the probe — the pre-priced
  casualty class, and incremental LM-cut's live-candidate case.
  Every timing above was contention-heavy; the quiet-box gate batch
  adjudicated what it could:
- **The gate batch, quiet box:** the board-budget differential on the
  NEW binary reads **11 regressions → 6** — sprint-resume recovered
  five of the named slice-losses; the six standing (peg-solitaire
  i16, tidybot i5/i11, parc-printer ×2, elevator i12) include the
  pre-priced probe-tax casualty class, incremental LM-cut's
  live-candidate case. And the two b-flip proofs LANDED: city-car i8
  **PROVEN cost 76** — v0.19's certificate to the digit — in 2.7 s at
  37,741 expansions; tetris i5 PROVEN cost 30 in 27.3 s. The cut
  boards remain the final referee.

## Phase 4 — the numeric-admissible bound (the proof boards learn numbers)

Mode::Optimal is numerically sound and numerically BLIND: onlycraft's
pure numeric goal reads h=0 and blind Dijkstra drowns at 8.4M
expansions on an instance the satisficing path solves in 23 steps at
~0 s. The design is a layer-index lower bound from the interval RPG
that already ships: monotone widening over-approximates reachability,
so the first goal-satisfiable layer lower-bounds plan LENGTH — an
admissibility argument that holds case-by-case in `widen()` and
FAILS CLOSED behind an audit.

- **L0:** `build_rpg` returns its exit reason (GoalAt/Fixpoint/Cap);
  `admissible_goal_layers` wraps it; `numeric_interval_audit` rejects
  by name the three shapes that break containment — scale-up/down
  effects (one-sided widening), undefined-at-init relevant fluents,
  monitored blocks. Audit reject ⇒ unarmed ⇒ byte-identical. The
  0.20 conditional-effect repair is the precedent for taking these
  rejects seriously.
- **L1:** a numeric arm in `optimal::solve` — `eval_h` becomes
  max(prop_h, num_h) (max of admissible bounds is admissible); the
  PROVEN note names its prover "+numRPG". Armed only when the
  certificate currency is length (all three -opt domains: no active
  `:metric`) and the audit passes. **No repetition-count shortcut**:
  ceil(gap/rate-now) is inadmissible when a plan can raise the rate
  first — sailing-wind's velocity assign is the live witness; the
  layer bound already encodes the admissible form.
- **L2:** root-drop guard — num_h(root) uninformative ⇒ disarm for
  the solve (dropping a max-component is always sound; caps the
  per-eval tax where the bound buys nothing).
- **Fixtures:** numopt-p01..p03 pins (h_num(init) ≤ known optimum);
  a new gap-60 pump-chain fixture pinning the layer counter's exact
  off-by-one forever; audit-reject pins with teeth; sailing-band
  through Mode::Optimal on the admissible side; trader-cycle stays
  the negative control.
- **Referee:** the (repaired) differential extended to all 354 +
  the 21 numeric certificates as the fresh regression surface,
  BEFORE boards. Band: sailing-wind-opt +5–9 (its 11 losses are
  blind node-caps; the last blind proof cost 2.86M expansions for a
  15-step optimum), onlycraft +1–4, rainbowttles +1–4 with an honest
  possible zero. This lever moves ONE 60-row board and is priced
  that way — it is the beachhead for the numeric-optimal cycle
  (PDBs/CEGAR, named deferred), not the centerpiece.

## Phase 5 — THE CENTERPIECE: the partitioned driver

The bet deferred at 0.20 ("the guidance swing") and 0.21 ("a
centerpiece for a classical cycle, not a side dish"), taken at last —
and the numeric decode says it is BIGGER than classical: the
139-instance numeric plateau pool (sailing-wind-sat, expedition,
petri-net, line-exchange, settlers-snp, ztalloc, coins — millions of
evals to nowhere on flat h) is the SAME mechanism wearing fluents.
One recipe, two families of boards.

**Phase 5A gates 5B — the ladder finishes learning the clock.** The
scoping receipt that demands it: tetris i4, a board TIMEOUT, solves
in 37.8 s under `FF_NOVELTY_ONLY` — the existing width-1 rung
converts it when given wall; the board loss is LAMA's 400k-eval
budget eating the clock first. (a1) LAMA gets a wall slice
(`FF_LAMA_WALL_FRAC` 0.25); (a2) the novelty rung gets one
(`FF_NOV_WALL_FRAC` 0.30 — last bounded rung, it can afford more);
(a3) rung affordability re-evaluated AT EACH RUNG ENTRY, not once.
Casualty watch from the fresh A/B: tidybot-2011 −2 and
openstacks-2011 −1 are the named EHC-slice suspects — solo-checked
here, quiet box, before 5B.

**Phase 5B — the driver, four levers smallest-first:**

1. **The R-partition:** subgoal feature set R = goal ∪ the
   extraction's need_fact stamps (heuristic.rs already stamps them;
   ~20 lines to read out), capped 256 by lowest layer; per-node
   achieved-R bitset, path-monotone; novelty cell becomes
   (unachieved_goals, r_count) — filling the (u16,u16) slot
   hardwired 0 today. Hatch `FF_NOV_PART=0`. Measurable A/B alone.
2. **Width 2, conjunction-cost bounded:** rank novel-1 < novel-2
   (new R-PAIR in cell) < non-novel; pair tables R×R only (4 KB per
   cell), marked new×true — per-state cost bounded by construction,
   never n_facts².
3. **The h-free driver queue** — the receipt is brutal: parking i1
   spends 86 s of cumulative worker time building h per pop at 100k
   evals. The new rung drops per-pop `relaxed_helpful` entirely:
   single serial open list, key = (rank, unachieved_g, |R|−r_count),
   deadline every 4096 pops. `FF_NOV_LAZYH` stays as a probe hatch
   (h on novel-1 pops only) if the tie-break proves too flat.
4. **The numeric-feature rider:** per-subgoal quantized log2 gap
   buckets as novelty features on numeric tasks (the charge's gap
   machinery + the 1e-6 quantizer) — this is the numeric plateau
   pool's lever, entering as a probe, promoted only on a measured
   numeric-board win.

**Placement:** the new rung REPLACES the h-guided novelty rung at its
slot (post-LAMA, pre-fallback). novelty-light stays untouched ahead
of LAMA — its +19 visit-all receipt is bankable and its slice proven.
`FF_NOV_OLD=1` restores the 0.21 rung wholesale. h stays OUT of the
partition cell (the in-tree degeneracy receipt, novelty.rs:8-12).

**Anytime restarts: not for coverage** — this codebase already
measured that shape (len_anytime: −9 coverage for +4 quality), and
the refill loop is the terminal wall-spender. But the decode found a
receipt that motivates a SEPARABLE probe: data-network i12 solves in
8.9 s with the fold hatched OFF (3.3 GB, byte-cap trip forcing a
refill restart) and takes 57.6 s with it ON (1.4 GB, no trip) — the
accidental restart was WORTH 6.5×. A deliberate
diversification-on-refill probe (new seed/weights per round) rides
this phase, pre-registered, cheap to drop.

**Referee discipline — the history is 2-for-2 against naive novelty
promotion** (0.17: +7/−51; 0.20: −26 until repriced), and both were
caught only by corpus or old-binary referees, never hatches. So: the
cut referee is the OLD-BINARY COLUMN — the v0.19 backfill plus a
fresh v0.21.0 backfill sweep — with casualties named per domain.
Canaries fixed now: visit-all 20/20 ×2, barman-agile 20/20,
quantum-layout 19/20, thoughtful 18+2, maintenance 16/20,
hiking-agile 14/20, openstacks' 12 EHC-direct rows. Pre-registered
solo probes before any board: transport-agile i1–i3, parking i1,
tetris i4 (must stay converted), snake i4, folding i1.

**The pot, honestly banded:** plateau trio 115 + ipc67 siblings 54 +
2018 search wall 150 + 2023 puzzles 107 classical, 139 numeric —
bands, not sums: classical +25–60, numeric +15–40. The 2023 puzzle
pot may simply not be width-≤2 (the field is near-zero there too);
it is priced at +4–14 of 195, not at 195. Excluded up front and
pinned as a negative-control fixture: child-snack (symmetry's, Phase
6's) — referees stay undiluted.

### Recorded — the driver takes the slot (old-binary column at the cut)

- **All four levers + the diversify rider landed**, fixtures
  RED-then-GREEN both banked (the pre-implementation RED lives as
  commit b67aae6 AND as permanent hatched legs): combolock pins the
  R-partition (86 vs 16,384 pops), pairlock pins width-2; the first
  fixture draft (stagelock) was replaced after measurement and the
  negative recorded.
- **The in-vivo receipt for dropping per-pop h:** in the same ~8 s
  tetris slice the old rung managed 21,135 h-evals, the driver
  explored 69,632 pops — 3.3× states per slice-second.
  FF_NOV_OLD=1 restores the 0.21 rung wholesale, pinned to
  byte-identical plan and evals; no armed wall ⇒ byte-identical
  ladder.
- **Pre-registered solos run and recorded, not tuned on:**
  transport/parking/snake unmoved at niced t1 (the pot is priced at
  board scale, as scoped); folding solves both binaries; tetris i4
  stays converted under the whole-wall probe (FF_NOVDRIVER_ONLY, len
  134) — with the honest caveat that the niced-t1 full ladder never
  reaches the novelty slot on EITHER binary (the 40% affordability
  gate under E-core pre-search; a Wave-1 behavior, recorded).
- **The diversify rider's pre-registered read came back null-armed:**
  data-network i12 now solves in round 1 on this binary, so the
  refill seed never fires (identical 473,488 evals both ways).
  FF_REFILL_DIVERSIFY stays opt-in; promote/drop is the cut's call.
- Driver plans run longer where both convert (tetris 134 vs 54 —
  h-free has no length polish); quality rides the improvement pass
  and the --score-against column. Suite 264/0 in-worktree.

## Phase 6 — the symmetry engine (the zero-traction unlock)

Confirmed at 0.21, three engines deep on one box: child-snack 0/20
opt + 8/20 sat with a factorial core, barman-2014 0/14, barman-2011
frozen — flat wall timeouts, no notes, no movement, ever. New
machinery, five levers, each sound before the next lands:

- **L1 (~60 LOC): optimal-mode canonical keys** — swap
  `task.state_key` for a canonical form at the three optimal.rs
  sites; nodes stay CONCRETE (canonicalization touches only
  visited/closed keys — the temporal pattern, so plan extraction and
  VAL are untouched). Orbit-space A* with concrete states;
  admissible h + the existing re-opening keeps first-goal-pop
  optimality. child-snack needs NOTHING else — detection fires today
  (sandwiches k≤20 SOLO orbits).
- **L2 (~120 LOC): the metric/cost-uniformity gate** — cells sharing
  an equality class must carry equal op cost or detection bails.
  This lands BEFORE any total-cost domain is enabled, with a
  negative fixture proving the bail (the soundness trap is merging
  quality-distinct states). Unlocks barman-opt, city-car,
  cave-diving.
- **L3 (~200 LOC): satisficing canonical dedup** in the parallel
  successor phase — canonical hash + canonical equality on
  collision, pay-per-duplicate so memory stays Phase-4-shaped.
- **L4 (~80 LOC): unary-goal SOLO units** (cave-diving's four
  identical divers, child-snack's children).
- **L5 (~60 LOC): goal-free-SOLO passdown into partition mode** —
  child-snack's SAT path routes through partition (probe receipt:
  "6 initial groups"), so the sat payout rides this lever.
- **Priced honestly:** the folklore "~30 barman pot" DEFLATES on
  probe — i1 shows a 2.77M-expansion wall against only ~4× orbit
  collapse (the goal pins most shots): barman is +0–4, not 30.
  Bands: child-snack-opt +2–6, cave-diving-opt +1–3, city-car-opt
  +1–4, child-snack-sat +2–8 via L5, hiking/transport +0–3. Phase
  total +8–20, and the TMS temporal constituency (goal-paired piece
  symmetry, the 0.13 fence) is named for 0.23 once the engine
  exists.
- **Referees:** the 354-certificate differential with orbits ON
  (zero cost mismatches or the phase stops); barman-sat 20/20 and
  GED 20/20 as no-loss canaries (the canonicalization tax has 10×
  headroom there and must keep it); t1≡t8 determinism pinned.
  Hatches: `FF_NO_ORBIT_CLASSICAL` isolates the new consumer.

### Recorded — the engine exists, and child-snack falls (differential at the cut)

- **The headline the cycle wanted:** child-snack-opt i1 — three
  releases of node-cap walls — is **PROVEN OPTIMAL cost 21, VAL
  "Plan valid"**, 324,276 expansions with orbits ON vs 769,092
  expansions and NO certificate hatched off. The ~20-certificate
  orbit-active sample: **20/20 exact-cost matches** (city-car 10/10
  against the vendored board certs, cave-diving 5/5,
  maintenance 5/5).
- **All five levers landed;** the L2 gate went in CLASSICAL-ONLY
  (detect_classical behind FF_NO_ORBIT_CLASSICAL; the temporal
  consumer keeps 0.21 strictness byte-identical — a deliberate
  narrowing of the spec's letter, recorded). The cost-asymmetry
  negative fixture pins the REACHABLE bail (state-dependent cost);
  constant per-member asymmetry is unreachable by construction and
  the fixture says why.
- **First sat deposits:** child-snack-sat i6 converts at 15.9 s
  (0.21: died at 55.7 s); i1 matches the board; the sat pot rides L3
  through the board path (the --mode partition route still merges
  itself out of budget — 5B territory, not this phase's lever, the
  L5 narration receipt notwithstanding).
- **barman deflated exactly as pre-priced:** i1 still no-cert at a
  1.71M-expansion cap with only [2,2] orbits — the +0–4 band is the
  record. Canaries hold with headroom (barman-sat, GED). The L1 hook
  was re-applied by hand onto the restructured AstarState at merge,
  as pre-arranged; the full 354-certificate differential with orbits
  ON is the cut's gate.

## Phase 7 — grounding scale (the walls that never reach search)

The decode receipts are unambiguous: 2048 spends its ENTIRE budget
enumerating 435M binding nodes to produce a 111-fact task whose
plan then takes 4,825 evals (~7 s) — every static literal names the
LAST-declared parameter, zero pruning above the leaf; the domain
header literally assumes a join-aware grounder. caldera i4: 2,292 of
2,292 stack samples inside the binding recursion. organic-synthesis:
all four precondition predicates DYNAMIC — static pruning has
nothing to hold (the 0.21 fixpoint receipt stands: memory flat,
time is the wall).

- **Lever 1 (byte-identical by construction):** MCV join ordering
  inside `for_each_binding` above a per-action typed-product
  threshold (`FF_MCV_THRESHOLD` 1e6): greedy bound-connected
  most-constrained-variable order, then survivors SORTED BACK to
  declaration row-major order before emission — the RawOp stream and
  fact-intern order are byte-identical, so the recorded sokoban-t
  regression class is structurally impossible here. 2048's 435M
  nodes collapse to ~50k analytically.
- **Lever 2:** threshold-routed fixpoint on classical/numeric solve
  entries (`FF_FIXPOINT_THRESHOLD` 1e8) — org-synth's and caldera's
  dynamic gating literals finally give MCV selective joins. Fact-id
  order shifts ONLY for tasks that today ground NOTHING inside the
  budget — "order changed" is vacuous there. A product-audit script
  asserts every currently-solved domain on all 13 boards sits BELOW
  the threshold (agricola, 246,879 ops on the plain path, is the
  named near-threshold case and the negative-control fixture).
- **Lever 3 (escalation, pre-priced):** indexed hash-joins, +1–2
  days, only if the pre-registered org-synth gate misses.
- **Gates, pre-registered:** 2048 i8 grounds <1 s; org-synth i01/i11
  <30 s (the exact 0.21 Phase 8 gate); caldera i4 <10 s — all solo,
  all before any board time. Bands: 2048 +2–8 (floor honestly 0 —
  the search behind the wall is unmeasured), org-synth +3–6,
  org-synth-split slice +1–3, caldera +1–4.
- Named out of the pot by probe: onlycraft (grounds in 1.3 s now —
  the 46 s transients died with Phase 6's fold era), settlers-snp
  (the wall is PARTITION-mode machinery, re-attributed to Phase 1's
  instrumentation), gear-car and line-exchange (search-bound).

### Recorded — the walls that never reached search, reached

- **2048 i8 SOLVES — len 203 inside the wall** — the domain that
  spent 67–74 s of a 60 s budget enumerating 435M binding nodes now
  grounds through MCV in milliseconds and solves. The family ramp
  read rides the gate batch.
- **The audit did exactly what it exists for, and the route bar
  MOVED:** the first full sweep found currently-SOLVED products up
  to 1.62e12 (data-network's PROCESS action) — far above caldera's
  6.4e10 — so NO product threshold admits caldera without re-routing
  solved domains into the recorded sokoban-t regression class.
  FF_FIXPOINT_THRESHOLD rose 1e8 → 1e13: org-synth (1.2e15/1.2e25)
  still routes; **caldera's pot is FORFEITED this cycle**, on the
  record, to a selectivity-aware gate (0.23 candidate). The audit
  asserts the new geometry and runs clean.
- **The composition seams became fixtures:** Phase 7's own levers
  dissolved two sibling phases' walls — the ground_wall or-goal bomb
  now simply SOLVES under the factored goal-check (pinned as the
  'factored' leg beside the budget legs, which hatch factoring off
  to keep the backstop pinned), and ladder_wall's bindstorm legs
  hatch MCV off for the same reason. Two 0.21-era receipts
  (onlycraft's 46 s transients, settlers-snp's "grounding" wall)
  had already dissolved or re-attributed before this phase touched
  them — both recorded by the audit's probes, not claimed.
- **The gate batch landed the rest:** block-grouping i3 — the
  4^21-balloon witness, field 20/20 — **SOLVES in 0.01 s, len 26**
  under the factored goal-check (the 18-instance pot is live);
  **2048 i9 solves in 0.04 s** — the family RAMPS once grounding
  falls; org-synth i01 routes and SOLVES (len 2) while **i11 still
  exhausts the wall** — the <30 s gate half-missed, so lever 3
  (indexed hash-joins) carries i11 as its named gate into the
  deferred list; caldera i4's forfeit behaves as designed (1.6 s
  honest budget exit); and agricola, the CONTROL, solved at 60.3 s
  solo — a borderline surprise recorded, not banked (the board's
  60 s kill makes it a coin flip).
- **The re-referee FAILED for sokoban-t, and the failure is a
  finding:** i21 ran >10 minutes against a 30 s wall — the TEMPORAL
  grounding entry is still unwalled (the Wave-1 exemption for
  validation re-grounding covers the temporal SOLVE path too), and
  MCV does not collapse push's joins there. Boards are protected by
  the runner's external kill, so nothing corrupts — but sokoban-t's
  34 stay walled, and "wall the temporal solve-side grounding" is a
  named 0.23 item with this receipt. The goal-factoring's
  optimal-mode interaction (a constant-m synthetic suffix, argmin
  preserved, stripped from reported plans) stays noted in code with
  no live optimal domain carrying the shape.

## Phase 8 — the denominator (the whole table on one box)

The think-big move that is not an engine bet: **2,290 instances sit
outside the honest table** in nine cloud-era boards the re-baseline
never touched. Three of them re-enter this cycle — propositional
(450), net-benefit (270), constraints (120) — 840 instances, ~5–6 h
of sweep at the standing discipline, no engine risk, and the table
grows 13 → 16 boards measured on one box. constraints was 5/120 even
on the cloud container: it is a coverage OPPORTUNITY wearing a
bookkeeping coat. The mco trio (840 more) waits for its methodology
sitting (wall-clock-per-rule on a 4-Super-core box is a decision,
not a default), and time/metric-time re-baseline with 0.23's
temporal tier so they are measured once, not twice.

Riders, all cheap, all named:

- **Makespan recording starts NOW** (one runner line + a pin): the
  column fills at this cut's sweep so 0.23's temporal boards can
  score quality without a second re-baseline. A 0.14-era runner debt
  closes.
- **The temporal attribution sitting** the h-surgery probe was
  supposed to buy and never did: the 100-timeout non-zero-block mass
  (floor-tile 35, sokoban-t 34, driver-log 19, satellite 12) decoded
  per family on solo probes — the free seeds from this scoping are
  already on record (floor-tile i2 pure plateau; turn-and-open i2
  dedup-heavy grind). Findings pick 0.23's temporal lever.
- **Vendor the IPC-2011 temporal field results** — no per-instance
  archive is vendored for 2008/2011, so the 110-instance zero block
  is currently priced against NOBODY: if the field also scores ~0 on
  storage-t/TMS at comparable budgets, the roadmap should say the
  ceiling is shared. Bounding the pot costs an afternoon.
- **Conditions for all**: the sweep driver writes conditions.json
  for every board, closing the 6-of-13 gap.

### Recorded — the riders land; the boards wait for the cut

- **Harness in** (the day the build opened): cut22-sweeps.sh /
  promote-air22.sh carry all sixteen boards with the 0.21 contention
  machinery wholesale — conditions-for-all comes free; the three
  re-entry tracks verified to enumerate; makespan recorded on every
  solved row from now on; the three labels moved to "sweep in
  flight" in the standings.
- **The sitting ran, and re-attributed a family.** floor-tile-t is a
  pure plateau both eras (best_h flat, zero duplicates, zero
  blocked — the clear-chain lever's constituency, symmetry
  secondary); driver-log plateau-provisional; satellite honestly
  PENDING, never guessed. The hard finding: **sokoban-t's bulk is a
  GROUNDING wall, not a search wall** — two of three probes died
  pre-search with stack samples inside `for_each_binding` (the
  Phase 7 MCV class; push's typed product runs 1e7–1e8). Its 34 do
  not price into 0.23's temporal pot until Phase 7's gates
  re-referee them. Protocol note for every future sitting:
  `FF_NO_ESCALATE=1` is mandatory for eval-denominated probes —
  escalation re-arms the eval budget and the goal-decomposer pass
  ignores it entirely. Table: benchmarks/metrics/
  temporal-attribution-0.22.md.
- **The zero block is priced against the field at last**
  (benchmarks/ipc2011-temporal-field.md, provenance labeled per row
  — the official 2008/2011 per-instance tarballs are LOST, and the
  file says where it looked): at the field's 30-MINUTE budget the
  block falls only to machinery we do not have — TMS to
  required-concurrency planners (POPF2 5/20; ITSAT 18/20 while
  every non-SAT 2014 entrant scored 0 valid), model-train to
  reachability at 60× our budget, storage to the ITSAT/SCP2/LPG-td
  class while OPTIC and TFD, the styles nearest ours, score 0/20.
  Half the field sits at zero on every one of the three: a
  planner-STYLE ceiling, shared with our nearest relatives. And the
  budget consolation, on the record: the 2011 coverage leader
  banked 144 of its 145 solves by t=196 s — the 30-minute tail was
  nearly worthless even to the winners.

## Phase 9 — cut 0.22.0 (the swing meets its referee)

The standing template — every board re-swept against the final
binary (sixteen now), records complete per phase, full pre-flight,
finish in main, the user publishes — plus this cycle's specifics,
all named above: the repaired differential runs at BOARD BUDGET
before any board; the centerpiece is refereed against the old-binary
columns (v0.19 + a fresh v0.21.0 backfill — budget reallocations are
invisible to hatches, the rule is two cycles old now) with
casualties named per domain; the three re-entered boards join the
snapshot; the comparability column re-prices the numeric boards
against the published field numbers.

The ambition, stated as bands that will defend themselves at the
cut, not as a promise: the engine phases sum to **+80–190 instances
on the 4,076** (Phase 2 +6–15, Phase 3 +20–30, Phase 4 +8–15,
Phase 5 +40–100 across classical and numeric, Phase 6 +8–20,
Phase 7 +5–16, less Phase 1's −8 debt repaid or recorded), which
puts the thirteen-board headline between **55% and 57.5%**, and the
grown sixteen-board table in the same band if the re-entered boards
hold near their cloud-era rates. The stretch — everything landing at
the top of its band — reads 58%. The floor — the centerpiece
repeating 0.17's history — is caught by the backfill column and
recorded, because that is what the column is for.

### Recorded — the cut sweep, all sixteen boards, one clean pass

Swept 2026-08-08/09 on `m5-air`, quiet-box discipline held throughout
(every board's `contention.py` verdict reads `clean`; the driver
finished in its first pass, zero contended re-runs across all
sixteen boards — `benchmarks/air22/*.conditions.json` carries the
receipt for every one, closing the 0.21 hygiene note that only 6 of
13 boards had them). Two real pre-flight defects surfaced and were
fixed before the sweep ran, both fixture/doc problems, neither an
engine-behavior change: a public doc comment on `optimal::solve`
intra-doc-linked to a private fn (`cargo doc -D warnings`), and
`ladder_wall.rs`'s `ground-wall` fixture had drifted small enough
that Phase 7's grounding speed now solves it inside its own 1 s test
wall on either build profile — recalibrated, not loosened. A third
apparent flake (`opt_wall.rs`'s sprint-resume completion) took two
tries: the first fix (widen the wall) was diagnosed wrong and
reverted in favor of the real cause — the forced sprint slice was
wide enough that release-mode h^max could just solve the fixture
solo, skipping the probe/resume path the test exists to exercise.

**The thirteen comparable boards (same 4,076 denominator as 0.21):
2,153 → 2,248, +95.** That is the low end of the +80–190 engine-phase
band, not the stretch — the floor case named in the ambition above,
not the collapse case the same paragraph also priced. Two boards
went backward and are named rather than netted away: **2014
seq-agile −1** (142→141) and **2014 tempo-sat −3** (70→67); every
other comparable board held or gained, seq-opt's net **+2**
(275→277) absorbing the gate batch's six standing differential
regressions (peg-solitaire i16, tidybot i5/i11, parc-printer ×2,
elevator i12 — pre-priced, adjudicated on the record already) against
the b-flip proofs (city-car i8, tetris i5) and the sprint-resume
recoveries that landed the same day. **2014 seq-opt +6.2 pts** (58→74)
is the single biggest mover — Phase 3's ladder and Phase 4's numeric
arm, compounding.

**The three re-entered boards overshot "near their cloud-era rates"
by a wide margin**: propositional 366/450 (81%), net-benefit 248/270
(**92%**, this cut's strongest board by percentage), constraints
5/120 (4% — the honest floor, mostly engine-reject on timed modal
operators the parser declines by name, not a search failure).
Folded in, the **sixteen-board headline lands at 58.3% (2,867/4,916,
373 certified optima)** — the stretch case, hit almost exactly, but
for a different reason than the ambition priced: not the engine
phases running hot, but the re-entries running far hotter than
"cloud-era" implied.

**What this record does NOT do**: the ambition called for refereeing
the centerpiece against old-binary columns (a fresh v0.19 and
v0.21.0 backfill on this box). That backfill sweep was not run this
session — STANDINGS.md's "vs previous" column (same-hardware 0.21.0
comparison, generated automatically) is the only cross-version
referee here. A v0.19/v0.21.0 backfill on `m5-air` stays open for
whoever next needs that specific comparison.

## Anti-pots, recorded so nobody reaches for them

- **A 120 s classical tier:** of the 19 instances that fail at 60 s
  and solve at 300 s, twelve need >150 s — a 2× tier buys ~2–4
  solves. Killed by arithmetic.
- **A 60 s temporal tier:** the fresh distribution tightens 0.21's
  estimate — the last budget doubling bought 18 solves at a 0.72
  decay ratio; [30,60) projects ~13–18 of 336 (3.9–5.4%). Mechanism
  first; the tier waits for 0.23 where it pays for the time/
  metric-time re-baseline at the same sitting.
- **Another temporal h-accounting variant:** eight
  mechanism-precise negatives, the last two run BY THIS SCOPING —
  the numeric charge armed on temporal groundings re-levels
  model-train's plateau 6 → 13 and stays flat at board scale
  (683,555 evals, no plan); pairwise agenda-doom kills 92% of TMS
  candidates AT BIRTH and best_h re-levels 110 → 180, flat across
  4×. The plateau is not an accounting artifact. The accounting
  lever class is EXHAUSTED on this wall; what remains is structural
  (window/deadline propagation, or the symmetry engine's temporal
  constituency) and belongs to 0.23 with pre-registered reads.

## Deferred, on the record (carried forward)

- **The temporal-focused 0.23, pre-scoped:** the 60 s tier move +
  IPC-5 time/metric-time re-baseline in one sitting (with the
  epsilon_separate 2000-happening pin BEFORE the sweep); then ONE
  pre-registered structural bet gated by probe pair — goal-
  isomorphism symmetry (the 0.13 fence, cheapest, sound by
  construction, cross-track constituency) before TRPG-lite
  (time-stamped relaxation, the full-fat version of what the
  endgate approximated; 486 solved rows are its regression
  surface). Storage stays honestly unattributed-to-a-winnable-
  mechanism until the Phase 8 sitting says otherwise.
- **Numeric-optimal proper** (PDBs/CEGAR on the Count Downward
  shape) — Phase 4 is the beachhead; the cycle after it decides on
  Phase 4's boards.
- **Incremental LM-cut** — promoted to LIVE-candidate-on-evidence:
  three certificates within 1.7 s of the wall say the near-miss
  class exists; Phase 3's boards referee whether it is the dominant
  residue.
- **The temporal solve-side grounding wall** — the sokoban-t gate
  receipt (>10 min past a 30 s wall, solo): the honest-wall work
  exempted every temporal grounding entry, including the solve path;
  walling it correctly (validation re-grounding must stay exempt)
  unlocks the sitting's re-attributed 34.
- **Indexed hash-joins (grounding lever 3)** — org-synth i11 is the
  named gate; i01 already routes and solves without it.
- **The mco methodology sitting** (three boards, 840 instances,
  wall-clock per competition rule on heterogeneous cores).
- **Per-node CoW leftovers; IPC-5 complex preferences; cross-mind
  planning; continuous `#t`; dynamic derived predicates** —
  unchanged standing lists.
- **The epistemic track (IPC 2026's other track)** — a watch item
  only: EPDDL is a different planner, not a phase.
