# ferroplan 0.26 roadmap — the proof gap, decoded first

Scoped 2026-08-25, with the 0.25 cut sweep in flight, by conversation —
the shape was CHOSEN against three named alternatives, and the decision
trail is part of the record:

- **The question 0.25 left open, in its own words:** "The 0.26 direction
  question — decided at the 0.25 cut with Phase 4's three decodes and
  Wing II's verdict on the table." Both are now on the table, and they
  point in different directions.
- **Wing II is NOT taken for a third cycle.** Two consecutive cycles
  have priced a SAT-wing band and not converted it to board coverage:
  0.24 priced +16–50 and delivered +1/+0; 0.25's wing produced a real
  refund (the conflict-rate bail: match-cellar i1 30.7→17.5 s, i2
  31→1.2 s) and still moved no board. Its own step-5 verdict is a
  MEASURED NEGATIVE for default-on. A third band on the same wing,
  without a new decode, is exactly the purchase the ten-negatives
  ledger was made of.
- **Centerpiece: the proof gap — and the READ COMES FIRST.** 0.25
  nearly tripled the optimal surface. After promotion the proof tracks
  are **669/1,906 (35%)**: seq-opt 287/550, 2018-opt 89/240, 2014-opt
  77/256, 2023-opt 33/140, 2023-numeric-opt 81/400, 2026-opt-full
  80/260, 2026-opt 22/60. That is over a fifth of the table and
  **1,237 unproven instances** — the largest coherent block of missing
  coverage anywhere in the record. The 0.25 roadmap already named it "its
  own future centerpiece candidate".
- **The sharpest framing available, and why it is a MECHANISM question
  rather than a wish:** onlycraft-opt is 2/20 against its OWN 20/20
  satisficing row. Same engine, same instances, same corpus. It finds
  the plans and cannot prove them. barman-opt 0/14 and parking-opt 0/20
  are the same shape. Something specific separates finding from proving
  on these, and it has a name we have not read yet.
- **NO BAND IS PRICED IN THIS PREAMBLE.** Phase 0 prices the centerpiece
  or refuses it. That is the whole point of the shape, and it is the
  0.24 lesson applied: "a priced band delivered +1. This cycle diagnoses
  before it constructs."
- **Co-headline: the instrument.** crucible is most of the way built
  (Phase 5) and its one remaining gap is the one that matters — the
  premise it was built for.

**Addendum, 2026-08-26 — the cycle goes big.** The field-gaps memo
(`docs/field-gaps-0.26.md` — drafted as a 0.27 candidate, adopted whole by
decision the day after scoping) folds into this cycle: the SGPlan ledger,
the modern-satisficing ladder, and the cross-cutting engine gaps, every
gate intact. The expansion phases are recorded below ("The field-gaps
expansion"), the executable specs land in
`docs/field-gaps-execution-0.26.md`, and the 0.26 cut sweep runs on
crucible (F6). Phase 0 keeps its primacy — the proof gap is still read
first — and the expansion sequences behind the 0.25 cut sweep now in
flight: no builds, no probes, while it owns the box.

## Phase 0 — the proof-gap sitting (light, NO code)

A design read, in the 0.25 Phase 4 mould, and under the house rule that
cycle bought twice over: **a design read is a committed artifact, never a
conversation.** Report lands at `benchmarks/metrics/attribution-0.26.md`
whatever it concludes, including if it concludes nothing is claimable.

The three pots, each with an exit clause:

- **onlycraft-opt 2/20 vs its own 20/20 satisficing row.** Read what the
  optimal path does on an instance the satisficing path solves in
  seconds. Is it a node-cap non-proof, an admissibility ceiling on h, or
  a search-order problem? The 0.25 Phase 0 re-check already established
  the sat gain is real and load-survivable and that **opt is a real
  ceiling** — so this asks WHICH ceiling.
- **barman-opt 0/14 and parking-opt 0/20.** parking already has a
  counted-case baseline banked this cycle
  (`benchmarks/air25-entries/parking-opt-i*.json`) — the re-derivation
  starts from receipts rather than from scratch.
- **The CEGAR-seeding question, folded in HERE rather than given its own
  wing.** `FF_SAT_BRANCH=fwd` measured a real **1.8× on the deep
  UNSAT-proof stack** (storage-t h1–32, 6.8 s → 3.7 s, stable across
  reps) and was disqualified only by its SAT-side poison (TMS-2011 i2:
  one refutation and a 0.6 s solve becomes 247 refutations and a capped
  budget). The proof tracks are exactly where the gradient measured
  well and exactly where there is no SAT side to poison. If the sitting
  finds proof-shaped horizons are separable, the residue 0.25 named
  becomes this cycle's lever with a measurement already behind it.

**Exit clause, stated before the read:** if no pot yields a named
mechanism with a priced band, the centerpiece is REFUSED and recorded as
refused, and the cycle's weight moves to Phase 5. A cycle that ships an
honest "no lever found" plus a finished instrument is a better cycle than
one that ships a band it invented to have one.

## Phase 1 — the centerpiece (weight TBD by Phase 0)

Nothing is scoped here until Phase 0 reports. What IS fixed in advance:

- RED fixture first, as always — an instance that today cannot be proven,
  which proves after.
- The band is priced against the field file with the budget gap named,
  and under-delivery gets the 0.24 treatment: measured shortfall,
  hypotheses named, never papered over.
- Anything armed at the sweep ships with its `FF_NO_*` restore. An opt-in
  flag no sweep arms produces no evidence, and no evidence means no pitch.

## Phase 2 — the standing corrections (light, each already named)

- **The mem-cap classification fix.** `ipc67.py:493` emits
  `"mem-cap (self-inflicted: node byte target raised)"`; `standings.py:262`
  matches `"mem-cap"` by EXACT equality, so those rows land in
  `early-exit` — the one column the refill loop is refereed by. Seven
  rows are misfiled in the published table (ipc-standings.md lines 52
  and 61); two more sit in ipc2014-mco-t8. Coverage does not move; the
  attribution does. The cut record carries the −7/+7 movement.
- **The PyPI wheel.** `crates/ferroplan-py` is a pyo3 extension-module
  and the one artifact `publish.sh` does not touch. 0.24 built and
  verified it in pre-flight and never published it; 0.25 is on course to
  repeat that. Close it, or record deliberately that it stays staged.
  (`maturin` is not on PATH: `~/Library/Python/3.9/bin/maturin`.)

## Phase 3 — the two open riddles (light, decode only)

Both are 0.25 probes that came back with the question sharpened rather
than answered, and both are explicitly carried forward:

- **pathways-metric-time is 0/30 AFTER both metric-time bugs were fixed.**
  The zero-duration skip and the [TREL] relevance-mask hole were real,
  the fixtures stay green, and neither was sufficient. Whatever blocks
  pathways specifically is a separate, still-unnamed mechanism.
- **tpp's empty `(:constraints (and))` does not explain its 0/30-vs-3/40
  gap.** i1 is unsolved at 14.2 s — well under the wall, so not a
  timeout. The riddle stays open.

## Phase 4 — transport L1–L3 (medium, and now legitimately unlocked)

The 0.25 anti-pot was "code at the transport wall BEFORE Phase 4's
decode". The decode happened, so the gate is open — and it came with its
own boundary in writing: **+8–20 of 211, on 2008/2011/mco ONLY.** The
2014 sequential boards are explicitly NOT claimable (coverage is monotone
in package count; the engine's line is ~12–14 packages and 2014 carries
25 everywhere).

The L3 probe reported in: with `FF_NO_NOVLIGHT=1 FF_NO_LAMA=1`, i4 solved
in 16.18 s and i6 in 58.98 s against the wall. Both solve — but two
instances is not a lever. **Widen the probe before pricing it.**

## Phase 5 — the instrument gets rebuilt (crucible, co-headline)

Most of this landed while the 0.25 cut sweep was being set up; the
record below is as written then. The ONE remaining gap is the one the
whole thing exists for -- see the closing section.


Scoped 2026-08-25. This cycle's headline is not the engine. It is the
**harness**: `crucible`, a resident Rust program that replaces the sweep
drivers, the runner, the contention watcher and the standings generator with
one supervised process. Design spec: `crucible-spec.md`. Working plan and
phase gates: the approved crucible plan.

The case, in one number from the record: the 0.25 entries sweep
(`benchmarks/entries25-sweep.log`) took **five passes and roughly 37 hours** to
bank ten boards, because a board measured under contention is thrown away
whole. Pass 1 burned thirteen hours and banked one board.
`PER-INSTANCE-RETRY.md` softened that to per-row reuse inside a pass;
crucible finishes the job by making the *database* the truth and the JSONL a
pure export, so a killed sweep loses nothing at all.

The discipline for a harness cycle is the same as for an engine cycle, and
one rule dominates: **a port that changes a number cannot prove it is a
port.** Every decision below follows from that.

---

### The sitting, before any Rust (crucible)

#### Recorded — the oracle is rescued, not retired

The Python is **kept permanently** as a differential oracle. `standings.py` is
1,104 lines of pure, stdlib-only, build-step-free code, and it is the only
independent implementation of the failure-class taxonomy that exists. Running
it beside crucible costs about two seconds per cut. Every incident in its own
comment corpus is a case of one implementation drifting from another
*unobserved*; retiring the observer to save Python nobody has to maintain
would be the same trade that produced the incidents.

What is being retired is the **shell driver and the model babysitting it**,
not the measurement code.

#### Recorded — the incident evidence was one disk failure from gone

`.gitignore` excludes `benchmarks/air*/` and every `benchmarks/ipc*.jsonl`
except the three optimal boards' raws — which it un-ignores with a comment
arguing they are "evidence rather than logs".

That argument generalizes further than it was applied. The **only** physical
evidence of the 15-instances-light incident — eight `factory-robot-2026` and
seven `data-network-2018` rows, both `val=false` because VAL could not
*ingest* the domain — lived in `benchmarks/air/`, gitignored, unbacked. So did
the only four conditions files on the box carrying a per-sample `timeline`,
without which the resume gate's contention side cannot be tested at all.

Rescued to `crucible/tests/fixtures/`, 108 KB, with a re-runnable extractor
(`extract.py --check`) that refuses to let a fixture be hand-edited into
agreement with a test. Provenance for each one is in that directory's README.

Two full 12-board backfill sets (`benchmarks/air-0.19.0/`,
`benchmarks/air-0.21.0/`) turned out to be tracked already, so the board-render
goldens are hermetic today without committing anything further.

#### Recorded — a live misclassification in the published table

**Found while planning the port, verified against the committed raws and the
committed table.**

`standings.py:262` matches `ntext == "mem-cap"` by **exact equality**.
`ipc67.py:493` — the 0.24 "label hygiene" change — began emitting
`"mem-cap (self-inflicted: node byte target raised)"` for the case where the
refill re-entry raised the node byte target past the declared model. The
labelled variant matches nothing, falls past the `mem-cap` and `spawn-fail`
tests, past the timeout line, and lands in **`early-exit`** — the class the
0.20 refill loop exists to empty, and therefore the one column the refill loop
is refereed by.

Seven rows are misfiled in `benchmarks/ipc-standings.md` today:

| line | board | reads | should read |
|---|---|---|---|
| 61 | 2023 numeric | `6 early-exit, 1 mem-cap` | `0 early-exit, 7 mem-cap` |
| 52 | 2014 seq-mco t4 | `2 early-exit, 1 mem-cap` | `1 early-exit, 2 mem-cap` |

Two more sit in `ipc2014-mco-t8`, swept and awaiting promotion.

This is the same shape as the 0.20 audit's finding that maintenance-2014's
"eight rejects" were ordinary timeouts wearing that costume: a label changed on
one side of a two-file contract, and the other side kept matching the old one.
Coverage is untouched — every one of these rows is an unsolved row either way —
so no headline number moves. What moves is the attribution.

**Decision: port the bug, prove the port, then fix it as its own named
change.** `crucible`'s `classify()` ships with exact equality so byte-parity
against the oracle is demonstrable; a *separate* commit then widens the match,
regenerates the goldens, and records the −7 early-exit / +7 mem-cap movement in
the cut record. `spawn-fail` has the identical exact-equality shape and gets
the same treatment.

After the fix the drift becomes structurally impossible: in Rust the runner's
note is a typed variant and the classifier matches the variant, so there is no
string for the two sides to disagree about.

#### Recorded — dirty rows are kept, dirty boards are not banked

`crucible-spec.md` §7 says to keep results measured under contention —
"coverage is coverage" — and re-run only where timing matters. This repo's law
is the opposite, and `contention.py`'s docstring says why: contention **only
ever depresses** coverage, so it "manufactures REGRESSIONS and hides GAINS",
which is the expensive direction to be wrong in when the output is a release
record.

Both are right about different things, and both hold:

- Every measured row is **kept** in the database, marked dirty. Nothing is lost
  to contention, the dashboard shows real progress, and a clean row later
  supersedes the dirty one.
- A board is **not banked and not promotable** until every row it carries is
  clean. Published semantics stay exactly as strict as they are today.

Consequence: the spec's `timeout_dirty` class and its separate "clean-timing
pass" both collapse away. Dirty implies re-run, for every outcome, not just
timeouts. `timing_matters` survives only as a scheduling hint.

#### Recorded — the resume gate's version check is too weak, and is being closed

`PER-INSTANCE-RETRY.md` names the risk — "a stitched board must never mix rows
from two different `ff` builds" — and then gates on the `ff --version` string,
adding "probably also the git SHA if the binary carries one". It does not.
Every dev build of a cycle reports `ff 0.25.0`, so **two different 0.25.0
builds stitch silently today**.

crucible gates on the binary's **blake3** and keeps writing `ver` into the row
for artifact compatibility. Under the candidate-driven trigger — where the
working-tree binary is rebuilt constantly — this was the likeliest way the new
harness would have produced a chimeric board.

#### Recorded — the sweep environment is scrubbed, and says what it was

`ipc67.py` builds the child environment as `dict(os.environ, ...)`. There are
**132** `FF_*` hatches in the engine. An operator with any one of them exported
in their shell silently changes every board in the sweep, and **nothing in any
row records that it happened.**

crucible starts from a scrubbed environment, injects the budgets, applies the
board's declared `env`, and stores the canonical `env_json` on the board row.
A row can no longer have been measured under a hatch nobody can name.

---

### Where `crucible-spec.md` is wrong

The spec was written from a conversation rather than from the scripts. The
corrections are in the working plan; the ones that are *decisions* rather than
plain facts are recorded above. The plain factual ones, briefly: the remote is
GitHub and not GitLab; the sweep runs **before** the tag, so tag-polling is a
backfill path and not the trigger; the manifest is a **selector** (regex over
variant directories) and not an enumeration, because the corpus is gitignored
and an enumeration would drift with nothing to notice; the default timeout is
60 s and not 1800 s; and a process cannot set another process's Darwin QoS
class, so mid-flight demotion is `setpriority(PRIO_DARWIN_PROCESS, …,
PRIO_DARWIN_BG)`.

One more, which is a decision: the spec's §5.1 tiering says Tier A should
"pack densely — timing not precious". **Here timing is coverage.** The metric
is coverage-at-60s-wall, so an instance slowed by a neighbour is coverage
removed. Packing densely *is* the contention. Tiering survives only as
within-board ordering (bank the known-fast rows early, so a mid-board
contention window costs less re-run) and as the ETA input. It never raises
`jobs`.

---

### Recorded — what the port actually reproduces

The gates below are the whole argument. A port that changes a number cannot
prove it is a port, so every one of them is an equality against the oracle or
against a committed artifact, run by `crucible/preflight.sh`.

**The published tables regenerate byte for byte.**

```
$ crucible --repo . standings --doc all --check
ok    detail   benchmarks/ipc-standings.md matches
ok    summary  STANDINGS.md matches
```

That is `standings.py`'s failure-class taxonomy, its IPC-5 archive scoring
(length and makespan, recomputed per `.soln` because the headers are empty on
the planner that dominates those tracks), the vs-field column, the Strong /
Middle / Weak split and the proof-track marks — all of it, from the committed
raws, identical to the committed documents.

**The classifier agrees with the oracle over every row on this box.**

```
314 agree, 0 MISMATCH (42,356 rows classified, 144 boards)
```

`classify()` per row, `coverage_line()` per board as an exact string, and the
corpus selector per track.

**The corpus selector survived losing its lookbehinds.** Two of `ipc67.py`'s
`TRACK_PATTERNS` use negative lookbehind, which Rust's `regex` cannot compile by
design. The manifest expresses them as include/exclude pairs, and the
equivalence is not reasoned about but RUN: all 26 tracks select exactly the same
variants, checked over the 292 variant directories on disk. Selecting one
variant too many or too few would silently change a board's denominator.

**Every committed raw round-trips byte for byte** — 43,186 rows across 144
files.

**The corpus enumeration agrees instance for instance.** All 26 tracks produce
the same variant list AND the same instance counts as `ipc67.py --track T
--list`, including the multipart labelling rule that keeps `ipc-2026n`'s 320
instances under 320 distinct keys rather than the 288 a first-group rule gives.
The independent confirmation is the sweep plan itself:

```
$ crucible sweep --set cut25 --require-version 0.25 --dry-run
set cut25: 6366 instances
```

6,366 is the denominator `STANDINGS.md` publishes. The board registry, the
track selectors and the corpus walk agree with the standing table without
having been told what answer to reach.

#### Recorded — three defects the port found on its way through

1. **`serde_json` parses some floats one ULP off.** `9189.980000000001`, a real
   metric in `ipc2023-numeric`, parses to `0x…70a` where both `std::parse` and
   Python give `0x…70b`. Every version tested does it; it is the fast float
   path, not a regression. A round-tripped board would have silently rewritten a
   measured number. Closed with `arbitrary_precision`, which keeps the original
   token.

2. **`Option<T>` cannot express this row format.** `makespan` is present-and-null
   on a solved row and absent entirely on an unsolved one — seven distinct key
   sequences exist across the corpus — so presence had to become explicit. A
   writer using `skip_serializing_if` alone produces rows that differ from every
   board ever committed.

3. **The spec's politeness lever does not exist.** `crucible-spec.md` §6 says to
   "re-set children to `QOS_CLASS_BACKGROUND`". You cannot:
   `pthread_set_qos_class_self_np` is self-only, and by the time the scheduler
   wants to demote, the child has long since `exec`'d. Demoting a running
   process is `setpriority(PRIO_DARWIN_PROCESS, pid, PRIO_DARWIN_BG)`.

#### Recorded — the supervisor's properties are tested, not asserted

Against a stub planner (`fakeff`) that does exactly what a test tells it:

- A child emitting 4 MiB on stdout does not deadlock the supervisor. `try_wait`
  in a poll loop without draining the pipes blocks the child in `write` and then
  waits for it forever, the moment `ff --json` exceeds the 64 KiB pipe buffer —
  which a long plan does routinely. Python's `communicate()` hid this.
- **A `SIGSTOP`ped run does not time out.** Wall exceeds its budget; effective
  time does not; the run survives and finishes. This is the property the whole
  project exists for.
- A stopped orphan is actually killed — `SIGCONT` before `SIGKILL`,
  unconditionally, because a stopped process never processes a signal it is
  asked to die by.
- A recorded pid that now belongs to a **stranger** is reported and left alive.
  The spec says to reap "from recorded pids"; pids recycle, and on a personal
  workstation the stranger could be the user's editor.

---

### Recorded — what is built, and what is not

Built and gated:

- **The publication layer, whole.** `classify`, coverage, the IPC-5 archive
  scorers, the bounds scorers, the field column, the history rules, and all
  three documents. `crucible standings --check` regenerates
  `benchmarks/ipc-standings.md` and `STANDINGS.md` byte for byte.
- **The instrument.** `benchmarks/manifest.toml`, generated from the five
  registries it consolidates and re-verified against them by
  `crucible/tools/verify-manifest.py`.
- **The corpus walk**, agreeing with `ipc67.py --list` on all 26 tracks,
  variants and instance counts alike.
- **The supervisor.** Spawn, process groups, the effective clock, the RSS
  watchdog, kill escalation, orphan reaping with pid-identity verification.
- **The contention monitor** and the FULL/POLITE/SUSPENDED machine, with game
  detection that follows Steam's descendants rather than a name list.
- **The scheduler**: the resume gate (gated on BLAKE3, not the version string),
  the quiet gate, tiering as ordering-only, the core budget as an admission
  gate, and a board loop whose atom is an instance.
- **The database**, the artifact writers, the promotion gate, the snapshot
  writer and the diff engine.
- **The dashboard**, and a `--dump` that renders one frame off-screen so the
  layout can be reviewed in a transcript or checked in CI.
- **`crucible sweep`**, end to end: manifest, corpus, measurement, artifacts,
  and the `.done` marker written only when nothing is still owed.

NOT built, and the record should say so rather than let it be discovered:

- **The sweep writes artifacts, not the database.** `db/` is implemented and
  tested, and `sched::resume` implements the per-sample window intersection --
  but `SweepRunner::attempt` still judges cleanliness from a before/after sample
  pair and keeps its rows in memory. **So resumption today survives a killed
  BOARD, not a killed PROCESS**, and surviving `kill -9` is the project's whole
  premise. This is the next thing to do, and it is wiring rather than design.
- **`crucible backfill` does not exist.** `repo.rs` carries the engine probe,
  the capability gate and the worktree-naming rule, with tests; nothing drives
  them.
- **The Linux cross-check is not armed on this box.** `preflight.sh` runs
  `cargo check --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` to prove no macOS-only call
  escaped `trait Platform`, and skips with a note because the target is not
  installed. `rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` arms it.
- **The clean-timing pass** collapsed away with the dirty-policy decision and is
  deliberately absent: dirty implies re-run, for every outcome.

### The gap that closes this phase

`SweepRunner::attempt` still holds its rows in memory and judges
cleanliness from a before/after sample pair. `db/` is implemented and
tested and `sched::resume` implements the per-sample window intersection
— they are simply not wired together. **So resumption survives a killed
BOARD and not a killed PROCESS, and surviving `kill -9` is the premise.**
It is wiring, not design, and it is the first thing this phase does.

After it: `crucible backfill` (the engine probe, the capability gate and
the worktree-naming rule already exist with tests; nothing drives them),
and arming the Linux cross-check that keeps `trait Platform` honest
(`rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`).

#### Recorded — the gap is closed (2026-08-28, `4336c35`, merged `8cae317`)

The wiring landed as the dossier specified it (F6 part 1), and the branch
merged to `main` under the finish-in-main agreement with
`crucible/preflight.sh` green on the merged tree: 378 boards agree with
the oracle, 0 mismatch (50,800 rows, 176 boards classified); 55,620 rows
across 186 raws round-trip byte for byte; the manifest agrees with the
registries. Every measured instance is now committed in its own
transaction the moment its run ends — before the verdict, before the
artifacts — and the verdict is `Reader::window_gate`, the per-sample
intersection over the watcher's box-wide timeline, not a before/after
pair. A restarted sweep reads back every row and every clean verdict,
regenerates the stage from them, and owes exactly what never banked.
**The JSONL is an export.**

The three unwired facts the dossier named, closed — and two it did not
name, found on the way:

- Rows are stamped with the engine's BLAKE3 under the resume gate's own
  key. That exposed a second defect: `write_row` was silently DROPPING
  `extra` columns, so the stamp never reached the raw. It keeps them now,
  last, in key order — no committed row changes (the round-trip proves
  it).
- The watcher persists the timeline; `live_child` is written at spawn
  with the KERNEL's identity (the configured path is not canonical on
  Darwin — `/var` is `/private/var` — and a reaper comparing it would
  spare every orphan as a stranger, which the first run of the test did).
- The in-memory clean set was keyed by instance LABEL alone. Every
  multi-variant board carries instance "1" once per variant, so under the
  old key such a board could never reach zero owed. Keyed by the row's
  full address now.
- `requires_version` on a `[[set]]` gates when the CLI flag is absent.

Tested, not asserted: `kill9_resume.rs` — the stamp; the `--no-db` hatch
writes the pre-database shape; a restart over a database holding clean
rows re-spawns ZERO (RED before the wiring: every restart re-measured
everything); and the real thing — a crucible `SIGKILL`ed mid-instance, its
orphaned planner found by the next one, identity-verified, killed, its row
closed. `gate_agreement.rs` holds `window_gate` and `sched::resume::judge`
against each other over every rescued timeline fixture, every window.

Two things the merge surfaced, recorded rather than discovered:

- **The crate's own tests were not hermetic**: a roundtrip test read a
  gitignored `air24/` conditions file, the e2e harness opened the
  operator's real `~/.crucible/db` from four tests at once, and three
  tests pinned counts one cut stale (77 solved on `ipc2014-opt`, the
  release list ending at 0.24.0, the tier-move warning). All now read
  git-tracked fixtures, their own scratch database, or the property
  rather than the number. The manifest is regenerated for the landed
  tier move (`ipc5-time`/`ipc5-metric-time` scored at 60 s again, so the
  manifest carries no warnings). The pre-flight's round-trip loop skips
  `benchmarks/metrics/` — a decode sitting's `matrix.jsonl` carries a
  `solved` key and is not a board.
- **The Linux cross-check (F6 part 3) is BLOCKED on this box, not
  armed.** `rustup target add` succeeds, but the gate's `cargo check`
  builds `libsqlite3-sys` from bundled C source and needs
  `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc`, which is not installed. The target was removed
  again so the gate reports SKIPPED honestly. Arming it is an operator
  decision: a cross C toolchain (e.g. `messense/macos-cross-toolchains`)
  or a feature gate that keeps SQLite out of the check.

Still open from this phase: `crucible backfill` (part 2), the Linux
cross-check (part 3, as above), and the cut-26 runbook (part 4).

## The field-gaps expansion (adopted 2026-08-26)

The program: `docs/field-gaps-0.26.md`, verified before adoption — every
per-domain number re-derived from the raws, the anti-pot ledger re-read
against every item, feasibility checked against source (the draft's 2014
"+16" died in that verification; what survived is what is priced here).
Specs: `docs/field-gaps-execution-0.26.md`. Order of operations: nothing
below touches the box until the 0.25 cut sweep completes and promotes.

- **F0 — the decode sittings** (committed reports, exit clauses, fixed
  probe budgets): (a) trucks/storage-time — one unnamed mechanism carries
  −49 gross across three SGPlan tracks and +4 flips ipc5-time;
  temporal-relaxation exits pre-excluded (that ledger is closed). (b) the
  cliff decode that must precede any forgetting/multi-heuristic rung
  (rubiks, floor-tile-class, the 2018/2023 residue) — the rung builds only
  on its number, per the standing width rule. **Executed 2026-08-29
  (`benchmarks/metrics/fieldgaps-B-cliff.md`): the rung as specified is
  refused; rubiks decodes to the h-guided novelty rung the 0.22 slot swap
  removed from reach (i5/i6 in 574/814 evals under it, the default
  ladder's driver 110k pops for nothing), spider to a binding driver
  `|R|` cap, labyrinth to a 25 s ladder tax; floortile refuses (a
  9–10M-eval flat plateau). Two narrower candidates — a bounded
  h-guided-then-driver slot and a per-family R-cap — were gated on the
  B2 pricing probe, and B2 priced them: rubiks **+1** (i6, at every slice
  width from 5% to 30%; i7–i20 unmoved) and spider **0/6** at R-caps 1024
  and 4096 — neither is built; the mechanism stays named with its
  reproduction (`FF_NOV_OLD=1`, 814 evals).** (c) metric-time widened to
  rovers i3/i5 — rides Phase 3's sitting. (d) the transport probe
  widening — rides Phase 4; prices the 2008 share of the +8–20 aggregate.
- Specs for every phase below: `docs/field-gaps-execution-0.26.md`
  (assembled + house-law-verified 2026-08-26; its Amendments section is
  binding — including the finding that the transport-L3 receipts are
  ipc-2011 rows, so the 2008 overtake rides entirely on F0(d)'s widening).
- **F1 — fallback enrichment** (ungated): preferred operators + `FF_CLM`
  into the bare wBFS fallback that does most of the solving; RED fixture,
  named `FF_NO_*` restore, old-binary referee; bands +10–17 (ipc5-prop
  tails) and +9-to-median (2018).
  **Recorded 2026-08-28 — F1 BUILT, unit-refereed, board A/B pending.**
  Landed as specified: `SearchCfg.pref_ops` (default false at every
  construction site — all nine other sites spread from a base), armed
  with the landmark term at 3.0 inside `plan_avoiding`'s guarded block
  (`FF_NO_ENRICH=1` restores the bare single-queue fallback; `FF_CLM`
  keeps its opt-in semantics under the hatch), `search_from` gains the
  lama.rs dual heap (192/64 shares, same 256 batch), `relaxed_helpful`
  as the evaluator, preferred insertion, and the node-cap byte model
  now charges `lm_acc` when the term is armed. Pin (`tests/enrich.rs`,
  child-process pattern, a 30-step chain with 14 junk toggles at a 4k
  eval cap): bare queue capped unsolved at 4,218 evals; enriched solves
  in **1,808**, plan identical at 1 and 8 threads. Measured and recorded
  rather than assumed: on that fixture the landmark term ALONE is inert
  (7,034 evals, identical to bare at every K from 14 to 20) — the
  deferred h already orders the chain, and the preferred queue's whole
  gain there is batch composition (~65 evaluations a round instead of
  256); attributing the two halves is the board A/B's job. The first
  real receipt came from an existing pin, `tests/novlight.rs`: the
  enriched fallback now SOLVES the 10×10 visit-all grid inside the
  100k-eval cap the bare fallback capped on — the exact h-plateau the
  novelty-light rung was justified against — so that test's bare arm
  runs under the hatch and the new fact is pinned beside it. Debug test
  pass green across ferroplan/cli/mcp. The referee is in flight ON
  CRUCIBLE: `f1-before` (v0.25.0 engine, the published cut) sweeping
  `ipc5-prop` + `ipc2018-sat` into `benchmarks/air26-f1-before`; the
  armed leg (`f1-armed`, requires 0.26) follows once the 0.26.0
  candidate is built — which waits for the before-leg to drain, because
  rebuilding `target/release/ff` under a live sweep would hand later
  rows a different binary than the hash they carry. The release
  `--include-ignored` pass and the `hatch-differential.py` "enrich"
  entry (its witnesses ARE the converted rows) wait on the same.

  **The before-leg banked (2026-08-28, 690/690 in 6 passes,
  `benchmarks/air26-f1-before/`).** Same 0.25.0 engine as the cut, and
  it reads **ipc5-prop 372/450, ipc2018-sat 86/240** against the cut's
  358 and 82 — **+18 from the instrument alone**: a quiet box (Brave,
  Steam and the other agents' build bursts were the competitors; every
  row they touched was re-measured until clean) and crucible's
  instance-level retry. That is the number the armed leg is judged
  against, never air25 — the cut's rows carry contention this leg does
  not, and crediting F1 with the difference would be the exact lie the
  old-binary referee exists to refuse.

  **The armed leg banked (2026-08-29 00:10, 690/690 in 3 passes,
  `benchmarks/air26-f1/`, `ff 0.26.0` blake3 `3709aeefc039`) — VERDICT:
  F1 stays default-on, +12/−2 on the same instrument, band
  under-delivered and said so.**

  | board | before (0.25.0) | armed (0.26.0) | net | gains | losses |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | ipc5-prop | 372/450 | **380/450** | **+8** | 9 | 1 |
  | ipc2018-sat | 86/240 | **90/240** | **+4** | 5 | 1 |

  Where the gains are: pathways +3 (prop i27, strips i18/i22 — the tail
  the band named, all three in the 56–58 s near-wall list the spec
  cited), pipesworld-strips +2 (i23/i24), **trucks +4** (strips
  i10/i13/i15 and prop i12 — the trucks cliff F1 explicitly did NOT
  claim; F0(a) owns that decode, and this is evidence for it, not a
  claim by F1), data-network +2 (i7/i16), flashfill +2 (i2/i3, both in
  the spec's i2–i5 cluster), agricola +1 (i12, 0 → 1). **Every one of the 14 gained rows
  carries the fallback note** — the mechanism witness the spec asked for.
  Plan length on the 456 common solves: one row longer, none shorter;
  time on common solves −0.1 s / −0.6 s mean; zero VAL rejects.

  The two losses, named: **trucks-propositional i10** (before 43.3 s via
  the fallback; armed unsolved at 58.2 s — a real loss, the preferred
  queue's order on that instance, offset ×4 on its siblings but not
  erased) and **spider i1** (before solved AT 60.0 s, armed unsolved — a
  wall-margin row, the class the 0.25 adjudication called churn).

  What did NOT happen: **settlers i12, the named must-convert RED fixture,
  did not convert** (59.77 s before, 59.78 s armed — untouched), and
  settlers moved 15 → 15. The 2018 +4 came from data-network and
  flashfill, not the settlers slice the spec claimed. **ipc5-prop reads +8
  against a +10–17 band** — under-delivery, the 0.24 treatment: the
  band's arithmetic assumed the near-wall rows were fallback-ORDER rows,
  and on settlers and storage (0 gained, i27–30 still at the wall) the
  measurement says they are fallback-COST rows — the enriched queue
  reorders but does not cheapen, and a row burning 58 s of h-evals is
  not converted by popping better. Hypotheses for the shortfall, in
  order: (1) F2's lookahead is the cost lever for exactly this class
  (settlers/storage rows sit AT the wall with the plan found late) — its
  differential runs next on the F1 binary ± the flag, which attributes
  the 2018 mass instead of double-banking it; (2) the landmark term is
  inert on chain-shaped tasks (the pin measured it) and may be inert on
  these too — the `FF_NO_ENRICH=1 FF_CLM=3` decomposition arm on
  ipc5-prop is the cheap test; (3) `relaxed_helpful`'s per-pop tax is
  the recorded 0.22 parking risk, and on the slow-h rows it may be
  eating the wall the reorder needs. None is pursued before F2's
  receipt lands.

  **Mechanism witness, re-read by rung (2026-08-29, solo re-runs under
  `FF_WALL_DEBUG`): 13 of the 14 gains are "solved by best-first
  fallback (round 1)"; agricola i12 is "solved by LAMA"** — a rung F1
  never touches, so that gain is the instrument's, not F1's, and the
  honest count is +13/−2. The correction that made this re-read
  necessary: the raw's "EHC found no improving state; used weighted
  best-first" note is emitted on `ehc_fell_back` alone (api.rs) — it
  says EHC handed down, NOT which rung solved. It is not a fallback
  witness, and two specs in the dossier (F1 §evidence, F2 §evidence)
  read it as one. Rung attribution needs the `wall: solved by …`
  narration, and from here on that is what the record cites.

  **The hatch differential (2026-08-29, `--spec enrich --repeat 2`, the 13
  fallback-attributed gains, `benchmarks/cut26/enrich.log`): shipped
  12/13, `FF_NO_ENRICH=1` 0/13 — the feature is worth +12 on its own
  witnesses, with every single row lost the moment the queue is bare.**
  Solo times under the enrichment: pathways-strips i18 13.2 s, i22
  16.4 s, trucks-prop i12 25.6 s, pipesworld i24 33.4 s — not wall-edge
  flips but mid-wall solves against 55–60 s failures. trucks-strips i13
  did not reproduce solo (0/2 shipped, 57.8 s — the board's 57.18 s
  solve was a wall-margin row). That is the attribution the spec asked
  for, on the rows the A/B named.

  Referee status: both legs on crucible, same box, same instrument,
  every row clean by the per-sample gate; the old-binary rule is
  satisfied by the before-leg itself (0.25.0 IS the published cut
  binary). The `hatch-differential.py` "enrich" entry is still owed
  (its witnesses are now known: the 14 gained rows) and is queued
  behind the lookahead differential on the same box.
- **F2 — YAHSP-style relaxed-plan lookahead** (ungated; never tried in
  this engine): opt-in hatch first; parking-2014's four 59.5–59.9 s
  solves are the fixture class.
  **Recorded 2026-08-28 — F2 BUILT as the opt-in probe, unit-pinned,
  A/B pending.** `FF_LOOKAHEAD=1` arms `SearchCfg.lookahead` under the
  same guard as F1 (so it and the cost-h rung exclude each other by
  construction); inside `search_from` it requires the bare classical
  shape. Per popped node with h > 0 the relaxed plan is read out in
  RPG-layer order (`heuristic::extraction_plan_ops`, a new read-out —
  the extraction only ever materialised a count and the helpful set) and
  executed greedily first-fit on the concrete state, each op once; a
  terminal reached by ≥ 2 ops joins the open list as one deep node on
  its own TRUE h at its real depth, normal heap only, its edge in a side
  table `reconstruct` splices; landmarks are accepted along the whole
  edge; a goal-met terminal is the plan. Terminal evaluations count
  against the cap. Flag-off is byte-identical (the read-out is dead code
  and the field defaults false at every site). Pins
  (`tests/lookahead.rs`): a 40-step serial chain — flag-off 40+
  evaluations, flag-on solves from the root's ONE evaluation with the
  identical plan, same at 8 threads; the read-out's layer order. The
  `hatch-differential.py` "lookahead" entry (parking-2014, roles
  inverted: the hatch ARMS the probe) and the board A/B (ipc2014-sat /
  agile, ipc2018-sat, on the F1-enriched binary ± the flag so the 2018
  marginal is attributed, never double-banked) wait on the box: they run
  on crucible after the F1 referee. Clippy on F2 waits for the same
  window (the box is quiet and the before-leg is banking; a build now
  is a dirty row).

  **Recorded 2026-08-29 — the parking differential is a NULL, and the
  reason is a decode, not a tuning.** `hatch-differential.py --spec
  lookahead --repeat 2` on the 0.26.0 candidate: 6/20 in both arms,
  identical times to 0.1 s, none of i1/i4/i6–i8 converted, no
  wall-sitting solve moved (`benchmarks/cut26/lookahead-parking.log`).
  Solo under `FF_WALL_DEBUG` the probe reports NOTHING on parking i2 —
  the search never reached a lookahead-eligible fallback pop — and the
  narration says why: **parking i2 is "solved by LAMA"**, at 48 s, after
  the novelty-light slice. Parking's solves are LAMA's, its failures
  spend the wall in EHC → novelty → LAMA, and the complete fallback F2
  was scoped to (by the note, misread — see the F1 record above) is not
  where parking lives. On a domain that DOES reach the fallback the
  probe fires on every popped node (transport-2008 i8: tried 18,596,
  yielded 18,596, inserted 14,763 — the 2× per-pop tax the spec
  warned about, in full) and converts nothing there either. So: the
  parking half of the exit clause is met; the 2018 marginal is measured
  next on the spec's own witness rows (settlers i12/i17–i20,
  data-network i6–i10, flashfill i2–i5) rather than a whole board, and
  if it reads ≤ 0 the flag leaves the tree per the clause. The
  LAMA-side lookahead — the rung that actually holds parking — is the
  deferred rider the spec named, and it stays deferred until a receipt
  says the mechanism pays somewhere. (Parking's 4/20 → 6/20 between the
  cut and the F1 differential's flag-off arm is the quiet instrument,
  same as the +18 above: i10 solved once in two repeats.)

  **The 2018 marginal (2026-08-29, `--spec lookahead-2018 --repeat 2`,
  the spec's 14 witness rows on the F1 binary ± the flag,
  `benchmarks/cut26/lookahead-2018.log`): −1.** Settlers i12/i17–i20,
  data-network i6/i8–i10 and flashfill i4/i5 unsolved in both arms;
  flashfill i2/i3 solved in both; **data-network i7 solved 2/2 without
  the flag and LOST with it** (the terminal evaluations' tax, on a row
  with no wall to spare). Both halves of the exit clause read against
  the probe, so **the flag leaves the tree**: `SearchCfg.lookahead`,
  `FF_LOOKAHEAD`, `lookahead_from`, the multi-op edge, the
  `extraction_plan_ops` read-out and `tests/lookahead.rs` are removed
  (`search.rs`/`heuristic.rs` restored to F1's shape; an archaeology
  note marks where they stood), the two differential specs go with them,
  and the receipts stay. What the probe taught, kept: (1) the fallback
  is not where parking, tetris or cave-diving spend their wall — LAMA
  is — so a lookahead worth another probe is a LAMA-side one, and that
  rider is priced only if a receipt ever says the mechanism pays; (2)
  first-fit relaxed-plan execution yields on every pop where it runs and
  costs a second evaluation each time — the 0.22 parking tax, measured
  again. F2 is CLOSED as a measured negative.
- **F3 — the gated builds**, opened only by F0's decodes: the
  `charge_pre_num` temporal hatch (the 0.22 charge-on-temporal negative
  declared; the workshop-economy fixture mandatory; `FF_H_ENDGATE`/`FF_TRPG`
  co-fire declared untested), AIBR/subgoaling numeric h, transport L1–L3,
  the forgetting/multi-heuristic rung. **`FF_NUMPRE_TEMPORAL` executed
  2026-08-29 (gate opened by Sitting C): built as specified (one armed
  line at the packed-task constructor, `FF_NO_NUMPRE` the deep restore,
  unset bit-identical by the short-circuit). Referee, the 2006
  metric-time constituency armed solo at 30 s
  (`benchmarks/air26-probes/numpre-temporal/`,
  `benchmarks/metrics/fieldgaps-F3-numpre.md`): pathways-metric-time
  **1/30 vs 0/30** — i1 converts (unsolved at 27 s → solved in 1.5 s,
  the board's first solve ever), i2 (the RED fixture) and everything
  above stay at the wall; tpp **3/40 = 3/40**; rovers **5/40 = 5/40**,
  the same five rows. The mandatory quality rider fired: the workshop
  economy re-routes 25 → 47 steps (chisel sale, never carves) under the
  armed charge AND under every damping half (`FF_NUMPRE_NODAMP/NOSKIP/
  NOSUM`, `FF_NO_NUMPRE_CHAIN`, `FF_NUMPRE_DEPTH=0`) — the 0.21 negative
  shape exactly, so the damping that fixed it on classical groundings
  does not reach the temporal one. Verdict: the hatch stays **opt-in**,
  +1 measured, no board arms it; `tests/numpre_temporal.rs` pins the
  unset carve plan and the armed re-route (if the re-route ever
  disappears the item is re-refereed, not promoted). Instrument note:
  Timberborn started six minutes into the probe (≈150 % CPU), so tpp/
  rovers rows are contended reads — they match the banked coverage
  exactly, and tpp i4 (the near-wall cliff row) solved solo at 8–10 s
  both unset and armed, i.e. it is wall-flaky, not flag-sensitive.**
  **Ladder dedup (Sitting A's F3 candidate, +2 firm) BUILT 2026-08-29:**
  `temporal.rs` skips the tight pass when its mask equals the sound
  mask, the unmasked backstop when the sound mask keeps every op (an
  all-true mask IS the unmasked pass — `allow` reads them identically,
  the only other use is narration), and the Full-tier escalation rung
  when the predicate-goal thresholds add nothing to the demand (read
  once by the numeric-tier pass function while its task exists, handed
  to `solve_ladder` through a thread-local; unset cell ⇒ rung kept).
  `FF_NO_LADDER_DEDUP=1` restores the quartet; `tests/ladder_dedup.rs`
  pins the exact saving on a mask-degenerate ring (8 monolithic passes
  → 2, the decomposer's contract passes shared) and that the solvable
  ring still solves. **Receipts PENDING a quiet box:** the first take
  (`benchmarks/air26-probes/ladder-dedup/`, engine af98f98131554a21) ran
  beside Timberborn at ~190 % CPU and every pass ran ~4× slower than
  Sitting A's ledger — storage-time i15's helpful pass reaches the same
  589,433-eval exhaustion but in ~52 s instead of ~13 s, trucks-time i12's
  never reaches its node cap inside 60 s — so both legs fail at the
  wall and the dedup has nothing to return; the skips and the Full-rung
  skip narrate correctly. **Retaken solo on the quiet box (12:16,
  `rows.jsonl`; the contended take kept as `rows-contended.jsonl`):
  trucks-time i12 FLIPS — dedup solved at 57.3 s (16 ladder passes, 16
  skip lines: the decomposer's contract ladders dedup too), hatched
  unsolved at 60 s (4 passes); trucks-time i13 solves at 59.97 s under
  dedup (board row: unsolved) — a wall-margin row, fragile at jobs 2;
  storage-time i15 stays unsolved both ways (21 vs 7 passes — the wall
  the dedup returns goes to the decomposer, which does not convert it at
  60 s) and i17 too. Priced: +1 firm (i12) +1 wall-margin (i13) on
  ipc5-time, against Sitting A's "+2 firm" — i15's flip was the
  `FF_TDECOMP=1` receipt at 51.9 s, and a returned ~40 s of wall is not
  the same as decompose-first. Default-on (it is a pure skip of
  byte-identical re-runs); the cut sweep referees the boards.**
  **Transport (Sitting D's +12, gate open) BUILT 2026-08-29 as a default
  move, after three probes corrected the decode
  (`fieldgaps-F3-transport.md`, receipts `air26-probes/transport-arrival/`):
  (1) the LAMA arrival flip is DEAD — 0 conversions on seven rows and it
  loses spider i1, the 0.24 canary, exactly as recorded; (2) under
  Sitting D's `FF_NO_LAMA` every conversion is the **novelty driver's**
  (`wall: solved by novelty-driver` on 2011 i1/i2/i6 and 2008 i8), and
  without the driver the fallback fails at 2–3× the eval counts the
  sitting quoted — those counts were the post-plan cost sweep, not the
  first plan; (3) with LAMA kept, `FF_NOV_WALL_FRAC=0.50` converts 2011
  i1/i2/i6/i7/i11 (5/5) and 2008 i18, 0.70 adds 2008 i8, spider i1 intact
  and faster at both. Shipped: the driver's slice default 0.30 → 0.50
  (`search.rs`; `FF_NOV_WALL_FRAC=0.30` restores) — the 0.22 record's
  own "0.5 converts loaded — the sweep referees the knob". Priced solo
  +6 on 2011 (2/20 → 8/20), +1 on 2008; four conversions sit at
  59.0–59.6 s and may miss at jobs 2. The cut26 like-for-like table is
  the old-binary referee the F5 law demands of a budget reallocation.
  `FF_COSTH_FIRST` (L1) not built: the driver is cost-blind and converts
  anyway, so L1 stays a quality lever, unpriced for coverage.**
- **F4 — quality + memory**: quantum-layout anytime polish (existing
  boards only, coverage-neutrality refereed — no new tiers), the
  folding/elevator memory sitting (+3–10 across boards), the storage-tc
  i8–10 fold probe, the floor-tile no-code pricing probe, and the
  model-train plan-then-schedule feasibility read — **executed
  2026-08-26, exit clause FIRED**: the pre-state duration core has existed
  since v0.10; the item is closed and its mass re-routes to F3's
  `charge_pre_num` gate (dossier §3.7). **Executed 2026-08-29 — the
  memory sitting (`fieldgaps-F42-memory.md`) refuses the memory build:
  folding and elevator are both GROUNDING walls (binding enumeration;
  folding never reaches search in 300 s, elevator-2008-strips i29
  overruns its 60 s wall inside `ground_v` behind a too-coarse
  checkpoint), which opens the or-aware-hoist rider's gate and names one
  small checkpoint fix — **landed the same day**: `WallTick::STRIDE`
  in `ground.rs` 8,192 → 256 bindings (the stride is denominated in
  bindings, and a binding's DNF work is unbounded), receipt elevator i29
  @60 s solo: returned at **60 s** with the no-verdict checkpoint note
  (was 80.7 s under the guard with no output at all); `ground_wall`,
  `novlight`, `enrich`, `refill` green. The storage-tc probe (`fieldgaps-F43-storage.md`)
  refutes the crate-count hypothesis with its twin (i8's LAYOUT costs
  7–21 ms per temporal node) and stays open on an instrument. **F4.1 (the
  wall-denominated length polish) is a MEASURED NEGATIVE and left the
  tree the same day:** built as specified (per-rung `SearchCfg.deadline`
  from the unspent wall, w_h 3/2/1 with the incumbent bound, ≥ 25 % wall
  gate, `FF_NO_LEN_POLISH` restore; unit pin green on a corridor
  fixture), then run solo on the three worst quantum-layout rows the spec
  named — **i13 212 → 212, i19 87 → 87, i20 129 → 129**, every rung
  spending its deadline (~60k evals each on i13) and returning nothing
  shorter. Two facts the spec did not have: all three rows are
  novelty-rung solves (driver on i13, light on i19/i20), not the
  fallback plans the note suggested, and a default-on polish would push
  every solved metric-free row's wall to ~60 s on the boards — an
  instrument side effect on the `time` column that no +0.02 quality
  read could pay for. The same verdict class as 0.9 (the restart shape,
  not the budget, is the limit), now measured at the wall too. Code
  reverted (costs.rs at F1's shape, the test deleted; receipts in
  `scratchpad`-era logs summarised here), the 0.9 opt-in
  `FF_LEN_SWEEP_EVALS` untouched.**
- **F5 — 2014 config reconciliation**: the hiking agile-ordering
  diagnosis, then the +6-oracle config schedule, old-binary refereed and
  priced after the referee (the true sat∪agile union is 155/280).
  **Executed 2026-08-29 — REFUSED
  (`benchmarks/metrics/fieldgaps-F5-hiking.md`):** the agile losses are
  evaluation-cost tails (i5/i6 solve at 300 s, i7 spends 101 s of 143 s
  in the heuristic), tetris i14 is a grounding-time row (27–47 s of the
  60 s wall gone before search across three reps), and the corrected
  ≤ +2 oracle does not survive either. No schedule is built. Flag for the
  cut sweep: hiking-sat i16 (37 s on the board) did not solve solo on the
  candidate.
- **F6 — crucible sweeps the cut**: Phase 5's named gap closes first (the
  DB wiring — resumption survives a killed PROCESS, the premise), then
  `crucible backfill` and the Linux cross-check; the 0.26 cut sweep runs
  on crucible gated on the byte-parity preconditions (`standings --check`,
  the 314-board classifier agreement, the 6,366-instance enumeration),
  with `standings.py` alongside as the differential oracle, and the
  mem-cap classification fix landing as its own commit AFTER parity is
  proven, carrying the −7/+7 movement in the cut record. **Part 4 progress
  2026-08-29: `[[set]] cut26` transcribed (32 boards, one stage,
  `benchmarks/air26`, requires 0.26) with every proof board at `jobs = 1`
  per Phase 0's cross-cutting finding; the enumeration gate caught a real
  crucible defect on its first run — the `--mode` probe read only clap's
  inline help shape, the 0.26 binary renders the long form, and all seven
  proof boards were SKIPPED (6,538 instances) — fixed and pinned
  (`repo.rs::modes_from_help`, three shapes); the gate now reads
  `set cut26: 8444 instances`. Remaining before the spawn: crucible
  preflight on the merged tree, `standings --check` + the classifier
  differential on the 0.26 candidate, and the certificate gate
  (`opt-differential.py --board-budget`, fresh `--out` under
  `benchmarks/cut26/`) — all queued behind the F3 receipt probes on the
  quiet gate. Part 2 (`crucible backfill`) BUILT the same day: the tag's
  planner in a crucible-owned worktree, the working tree's instrument, the
  version gate skipped, stage `benchmarks/air-<ver>/`, feature-absent
  boards now leave a `feature-absent` pass row for any engine; the RED
  fixture `backfill --tag v0.18.0 --set cut25 --dry-run` converted (built
  in 1 m 21 s, three proof boards skipped, 5,500 instances planned). The
  suite also caught `STANDINGS.md` stale since the 0.25.0 publish ("vs
  0.24.0" → "vs 0.25.0", both renderers agree) — regenerated. **Gates
  run 2026-08-29 13:37–14:06 on the final candidate (`ff 0.26.0`,
  blake3 `03a17198744b`): crucible preflight clean (after one red — the
  round-trip walk read a probe receipt as a board raw; `air26-probes/`
  now skipped like `metrics/`), standings parity ok both docs, 378
  agree / 0 MISMATCH, certificate gate 382 agree / 0 mismatch / 0
  REGRESSION at board budget, enumeration 8,444. THE 0.26 CUT SWEEP
  SPAWNED 14:07 in a Terminal (`crucible sweep --set cut26
  --require-version 0.26`, log `benchmarks/cut26-sweep.log`, stage
  `benchmarks/air26/`, DB `~/.crucible/db`) — the first cut swept by
  crucible, the shell drivers standing by as the fallback instrument.**

Standing correction already landed with the adoption (2026-08-26):
`docs/ipc-rankings.md`'s constraints row refreshed from the committed raws
— the "12/120, 70 rows rejected" text was two cycles stale; the row now
records 28/120, zero rejects, storage-tc won outright, 2nd-of-3 on the
official subset. Every fence in the memo's §4 carries into this cycle's
anti-pot list by reference.

## Phase 6 — cut 0.26.0

The standing template. What this cycle forces on top:

- **The like-for-like table is now 32 boards, not 22.** 0.25's entry day
  moved the headline from 63% (3,981/6,366) to 56% (4,743/8,444) by
  growing the denominator. From this cycle on that IS the instrument, and
  0.26 is the first cut that can show movement against it.
- The doc gate runs EARLY. The private-intra-doc-link class has struck
  three cycles running; 0.25 finally caught it at authoring. Keep it there.
- Pre-flight is the four-crate order (ferroplan-sat → ferroplan →
  ferroplan-cli → ferroplan-mcp).
- The sweep itself runs on crucible (F6) — the shell drivers stay
  runnable as the fallback, and `standings.py` referees byte-parity.
- If Phase 0 refused the centerpiece, the cut record says so in its first
  paragraph, not its last.

## Anti-pots — priced at zero, standing

Everything 0.25 listed carries forward unchanged: temporal
delete-relaxation (ledger CLOSED), org-synth i11, agricola's coin-flip
class, ricochet, **openstacks-opt PDBs (probe-NEGATIVE, mechanism
named — and directly relevant to Phase 0, which must not re-buy it)**,
a second classical driver swing, temporal orbit-iso, the 1998–2004
corpora, and new 300 s tiers.

Added this cycle:

- **A third SAT-wing band without a new decode.** The wing keeps its
  opt-in hooks and its refunds; what it does not get is another priced
  band on the strength of the last two. Phase 0 may hand it one — that
  is a different thing, and the difference is a measurement.
- **Code at the pathways or tpp walls before Phase 3's decode.** Same
  rule that governed transport, for the same reason, on the same
  evidence.

- **The field-gaps §4 fences, incorporated by reference** (added
  2026-08-26): no code at the pathways/tpp walls pre-decode (rovers
  treated the same by this cycle's own extension), no temporal
  delete-relaxation ever, no STN-shaped model-train revival, no
  2014-transport claims from L1–L3, no un-decoded novelty promotion, no
  anytime-for-coverage, no new tiers.

## Deferred, on the record (carried forward)

- ITSAT-style in-CNF timing; incremental assumptions (only if
  horizon-ramp profiling demands them).
- caldera's selectivity-aware route gate; block-grouping's search residue
  (10 rows, field ceiling proven); the or-aware hoist for folding p01
  (sized, not taken — folding's 300 s face is a MEMORY ceiling).
- floor-tile's irreversible-consumption dead-end test: one NEW lever
  named at 0.25 with a no-code pricing probe attached, unclaimed.
- Cross-mind planning; continuous `#t`; dynamic derived predicates — the
  standing lists.
