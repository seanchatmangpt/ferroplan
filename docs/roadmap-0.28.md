# ferroplan 0.28 roadmap — the rung 0.27 skipped

Scoped 2026-09-06, while the 0.27 cut sweep was still running. **This cycle
does not merge to `main` until 0.27.0 is published**: the cut is measuring
`ff 0.27.0 [86302e06d81b]`, and an engine change on `main` would re-identify
the binary the sweep is halfway through. All 0.28 work lives on
`engine-0.28` in its own worktree (`/Users/harold/ferroplan-0.28`, its own
`target/`) so a build here cannot touch the binary the sweep spawns.

The headline is not a new mechanism. It is a lever this project already
built, already measured, and wired into three of its four search rungs.

---

## The finding this cycle is built on

0.27 added the anchored successor generator (`PackedTask::applicable_ops`,
`packed.rs`): expansion walks the state's true facts through an index
instead of testing every grounded operator. It was wired into the
classical rung (`search.rs:1038`), the LAMA rung (`lama.rs:343`) and the
novelty rungs (`novelty.rs:317/467/784`).

It was **not** wired into the temporal rung. `temporal.rs:3291` is still

    (0..task.n_ops).filter(|&oi| allow(oi)).collect()

and `grep -c applicable_ops crates/ferroplan/src/temporal.rs` returns 0.

That omission ran a controlled experiment nobody designed. Between
`benchmarks/air26/` and `benchmarks/air27/` there is exactly one engine
commit (`git log 677eafc..HEAD -- crates/ferroplan/src` → `69cb96a`), and
on the boards the 0.27 sweep has finished:

| board | 0.26 | 0.27 | delta | rung wired |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| ipc2014-sat | 161 | 173 | **+12** | yes |
| ipc2014-agile | 158 | 172 | **+14** | yes (board still owed rows) |
| ipc67-netben | 268 | 270 | +2 | yes |
| ipc2026-opt | 22 | 23 | +1 | yes |
| **ipc2014-tempo** | **78** | **78** | **±0** | **no** |

Two things follow, and the second one matters as much as the first.

1. **The lever has an in-house price.** The identical change bought +12 and
   +14 where it was wired. Its temporal constituency is real: 83 of the
   122 unsolved rows on `ipc2014-tempo` carry the note "temporal ladder
   stopped at the wall" — storage-t 18/20, floor-tile-t 18/19, rtam 14/16,
   driver-log 10/19.
2. **It rules out the instrument as the explanation for 0.27's gains.**
   The packed scheduler applied to every board equally. If the movement
   were width, `ipc2014-tempo` would have moved too. It did not.

---

## Phase 0 — the entry gate (blocking, no cycle work until it closes)

1. **cut27 reaches a terminal state.** Five of thirty-two boards are
   `.done`; no 0.28 row claim is refereeable against a partial baseline.
2. **The two-binary differential.** Same box, solo, alternating, three
   reps, a canary reading between pairs: `ff 0.26.0 [03a17198744b]` against
   `ff 0.27.0 [86302e06d81b]` over every instance 0.26 solved that 0.27
   did not. Pre-registered fork, written before the numbers land:
   - both fail now → the box changed, not the engine;
   - 0.26 solves and 0.27 fails → `69cb96a`'s byte-identity claim is false
     in the field, **Lane A does not open**, and the cycle's first job is
     that defect;
   - both solve → conditions, and every packed 0.27 row is suspect.
   The differential doubles as Lane A's referee, so it is run once and
   used twice.
3. **Real width on the row.** Every raw still stamps the manifest's
   `jobs = 2` whether it was measured 2-wide (air25), 1-wide (air26) or
   10-wide (air27). Until the measured concurrency is on the row, no
   reader can separate a +N from packing noise. Known prerequisite: the
   runner passes the NOMINAL batch width, fixed outside the worker scope,
   while the width policy collapses the real one constantly.
4. **The cut27 postmortem**, as Phase 4 of the 0.27 roadmap pre-registered
   it: passes, wall-clock hours, and the box's condition, whatever they say.

### Phase 0 — status, 2026-09-16

1. **CLOSED.** All 32 cut27 boards are `.done`; 0.27.0 was promoted and
   published 2026-09-10 (5,122/8,444).
2. **Run 2026-09-16, same box, both binaries alternating, 3 reps.** The
   lost set, read from the crucible database: 22 instances where 0.26.0
   [03a17198744b] banked a solve in the cut26 sweep and 0.27.0
   [86302e06d81b] banked a miss in cut27. Neither original binary survives
   (`target/` was rebuilt), so the pair is `v0.26.0` rebuilt [8fe896b4fd53]
   against `v0.27.0` rebuilt. 16 of the 22 were solved by 0.26 at ≥ 58 s
   of a 60 s wall. Results are recorded below the postmortem.

   **CLOSED 2026-09-16: the fork reads "not the engine".** Each cell
   counts solves out of 3 repeats. The canary read 0.49–1.14 s (median
   0.55) across 66 readings. The box was shared with the v0.26.0 backfill.
   In repeat 1, three tetris-mco runs peaked near 8 GB each and pushed it
   into swap; that is the repeat where everything failed.

   | outcome | instances | 0.26 | 0.27 |
   |---|---|---:|---:|
   | both solve | tetris-mco t2 i16, t4 i15, t4 i16, t8 i16; hydropower-opt i14; elevator-t i10; elevator-t-strips i28; pathways-complex i11 | 18/24 | 18/24 |
   | 0.27 solves, 0.26 does not | parking-agile i10; parking-mco-t8 i1, i9, i17; recharging-robots i14 | 1/15 | 12/15 |
   | both fail | spider i17; folding-agile-300s i2; recharging-robots i4; storage-qual i12, i18; scanalyzer i18, strips i28; parking-mco-t4 i19 | 0/24 | 0/24 |
   | 0.26 once, 0.27 never | scanalyzer-strips i29 | 1/3 | 0/3 |

   Not one instance fits "0.26 solves and 0.27 fails". The single 0.26-only
   solve is 1 of 3 at the wall. `69cb96a`'s byte-identity claim holds in the
   field, and the 22 cut27 misses are conditions (8 failures shared by
   both binaries, 8 instances that both solve on a quieter box) plus five
   rows where 0.27 is the stronger binary. The Lane A arm is moot, since
   that lane is already a recorded negative.

   **The whole-set answer, 2026-09-18.** The v0.26.0 backfill of cut27
   finished — 32/32 boards, 765 banked in 9 passes, no row owed on either
   side — so `crucible compare` now answers the question like for like on
   one box, one referee, one binary identity per side
   (`benchmarks/cut27-compare-0.26-vs-0.27.txt`):

   **0.26.0 [8fe896b4fd53] 5,007 · 0.27.0 [86302e06d81b] 5,122 · net
   +115.** 0.27 is ahead on 22 boards, level on 6, behind on 4:
   ipc5-qual-pref −5, ipc5-complex-pref −2, ipc67-temporal −1,
   ipc2023-agile-300s −1.

   Per instance, 15 rows went 0.26-solved → 0.27-unsolved (board nets hide
   the ones 0.27 won back). **Twelve of the 15 were 0.26 solves at ≥ 57 s
   of a 60 s wall**, i.e. wall-edge rows, and the three that were not are
   elevator-temporal-strips i28 (46.5 s), tidybot-mco-t2 i20 (42.6 s) and
   the two 300 s agile rows at 298 s. The differential above re-ran
   elevator-t-strips i28 three times against both binaries and both solved
   every time. The published +134 stands; the honest like-for-like figure
   for the cycle is **+115**, and the difference is the 0.26 baseline
   re-measured on today's box rather than on cut26's.

   > **SUPERSEDED 2026-09-19 — see "THE INSTRUMENT" below.** "One binary
   > identity per side" was necessary and not sufficient: the two sides
   > were not given the same NUMBER of attempts. 0.26.0 re-ran 27.0 % of
   > its failures, 0.27.0 re-ran 68.7 % of its, neither ever re-ran a
   > solve, and the banked delta decomposes as first-attempt −18 plus a
   > rescue difference of +133. Under equal-N the same runs read −41
   > [−80, +1]. The +115 is not like-for-like; it is max-over-unequal-N.
3. **BUILT** (`crucible-r2` fd4ea3f). A row's `neighbours` is now the PEAK
   number of planners that ran beside it over its lifetime, not
   `width − 1` fixed before the workers started. It goes to the
   database, where the referee reads it, and onto the raw row as
   `neighbours`. The resume identity keeps `jobs`, so no banked row is
   re-owed. The running resident still uses the old binary until it is
   restarted.
4. **The cut27 postmortem.** The pre-registration was one pass plus its
   solo tail, within 36 h. **It took 141 h of wall-clock** (2026-09-04
   22:20 → 09-10 19:28) across nine sweep sessions; the last one finished
   in 2 passes. 12,800 runs banked 8,444 rows, and 2,486 instances took
   more than one run (at most 18). Of the 134.6 planner-hours, **63.4
   (47 %) went to runs that were not banked**:

   | verdict (not banked) | runs | planner-h |
   |---|---:|---:|
   | demoted (the E-core defect, fixed 09-07) | 1,996 | 33.1 |
   | thermal | 878 | 13.9 |
   | starved | 682 | 4.2 |
   | packed | 259 | 4.3 |
   | contended | 307 | 4.2 |
   | suspect / recheck / swap / uncovered | 234 | 3.8 |

   The box's condition: in ordinary use throughout. Worst incident: the
   09-07 disk cleanup deleted `target/` and the sweep sat dead for 11 h.
   The E-core demotion alone cost more than the whole 36 h budget. Mean
   nominal neighbours on the record: 2.4, max 9. That number is the old
   stamp, which is what item 3 fixes.

## Lane A (headline) — the temporal successor rung

**Measure first.** A per-expansion split (candidate scan / h / apply) on
driver-log-t i5 (61,092 ops, 1.0–1.1k evals/s), rtam i16 (13,176 ops,
~4.5k/s), satellite i5 (17,676 ops, 5.5k/s) and storage-time i15 (3,744
ops), on a quiet box.

**Pre-registered kill:** if the candidate scan is under ~10 % of the
per-evaluation wall on all four, the lever is a **recorded negative that
day** and Lane A ends there. Nobody has read the scan's share of a
*temporal* evaluation; `temporal-attribution-0.23.md` measured a different
term (h-build per eval), and 0.27 already recorded that one as a negative.

**Band, labelled as interpolation:** +2 to +8 on `ipc2014-tempo`,
concentrated on storage-t and rtam. NOT the +10–30 the 0.27 speed lane
pre-registered for itself.

**Carve-out:** the orbit/symmetry block records a generator class before
the applicability test, so the substitution is not byte-identical under
`FF_ORBIT_GEN=1` — that arm keeps the full scan, and it is already a
recorded negative ("match-cellar lost 9 instances to it").

### Lane A — RECORDED NEGATIVE, 2026-09-11. The lane ends here.

The pre-registered kill fired. Candidate-scan SELF time, sampled on a box
with one competing core (Steam), `FF_NO_TSUCC=1` so the full scan is the
thing being measured, `sample` at ~1 kHz:

| instance | ops | scan share | heuristic share |
|---|---|---|---|
| driver-log-t i5 | 61,092 | **0.01 %** | 99.6 % |
| rtam i16 | 13,176 | **7.70 %** | ~97 % |
| satellite i5 | 17,676 | **0.09 %** | 98.7 % |
| storage-t i15 | 3,744 | **0.72 %** | 96.9 % |

Under ~10 % on all four, which is the condition this lane wrote down in
advance for ending itself. The 7.70 % on rtam is the loose end and it is
loose in the safe direction: that sample carries more than one thread, so
its denominator is understated and the true share is lower.

**Why it is not close.** 61,092 ops was chosen as the case where an
O(n_ops) scan should hurt most, and it is the instance where the scan is
LEAST visible — 0.01 %. Every sample that is not the scan is the relaxed
planning graph: `push_node → eval_node → relaxed_helpful →
relaxed_to_inner → build_rpg`, 16,384 of 16,441 samples on driver-log-t.
The scan does not even appear as a frame; it inlines into
`temporal_search` and shows only as self time.

**What this confirms rather than discovers.** 0.27 recorded the same shape
for the classical path: "what is left on these boards is the relaxation
floor itself, ~1.7-2 ms per evaluation at 60-80k ops, proportional to the
effects the fired ops carry. Moving it means firing fewer ops (relevance)
or evaluating fewer states, not a faster scan." Nobody had read that
share for a TEMPORAL evaluation, which is why the measurement was worth
its afternoon. It reads the same.

**The code stays.** `98a74e1` wires the anchored generator into the
temporal rung and is byte-identical by construction (candidates sorted
back into the scan's order), so it is neither a win nor a risk: it
removes a 0.01-7.7 % term and costs nothing. `FF_NO_TSUCC=1` keeps the
full scan for exactly this kind of measurement. What is withdrawn is the
CLAIM -- the +2 to +8 band on `ipc2014-tempo` is not pursued and no
differential is run for it, because a term that small cannot pay for one.

**Cost of the lane:** one afternoon, four samples, no sweep.

## Lane A' (the replacement headline) — the node cap is a model, and the model may be wrong

Lane A died on its own kill criterion the same afternoon it was measured,
so this takes the headline. It comes from the 0.27 cut rather than from a
guess.

**The observation.** 937 rows across the seven optimality boards banked
UNSOLVED with the note `inconclusive: node cap reached after N
expansions`. They did not run out of time; they ran out of node budget.
And they did it while barely touching the 6 GB the boards declare:

| board | capped rows | avg GB actually used |
|---|---|---|
| ipc-opt-2008-11 | 253 | 1.74 |
| ipc2023-numeric-opt | 179 | 3.36 |
| ipc2014-opt | 174 | 1.38 |
| ipc2018-opt | 117 | **0.93** |
| ipc2026-opt-full | 96 | 4.38 |
| ipc2023-opt | 81 | **0.80** |
| ipc2026-opt | 37 | 4.00 |

`ipc2018-opt` stops having used 15 % of its declared budget. The cap is
derived from `node_bytes_target` over a MODEL of per-insertion cost --
deliberately, because the count has to be serial and thread-count
independent, so it can never be RSS. That design is right. The question
nobody has asked is whether the model's bytes-per-node is ACCURATE, and
four boards stopping under 2 GB of a 6 GB budget is what makes it worth
asking.

**The receipt.** `openstacks-sequential-optimal-strips/16`, traced at the
0.27 cut: 0.26 proved it in 53.29 s using 3.82 GB and 4,250,212
expansions; 0.27 capped at 3,798,074 expansions with 3.05 GB -- 89 % of
the way to a proof it had the memory to finish. The cut-time re-check
proved it again on a quiet box. One row, but it is the mechanism in
miniature: the cap, not the clock, and not the engine.

**Measure first.** Modelled bytes-per-node against measured, on the four
boards with the widest gap (2018-opt, 2023-opt, 2014-opt,
opt-2008-11). The measurement is RSS growth over nodes inserted across a
run, compared with what `per_node_model_bytes` predicted for the same
task. No engine change to take the measurement.

**Pre-registered kill:** if the model is within 25 % of measured
bytes-per-node on all four, the caps are honest memory exhaustion, this
lane is a **recorded negative that day**, and the proof tracks' ceiling is
real rather than self-inflicted. Raising a cap that is already accurate
would buy swap, not proofs -- and the referee already owes 50 rows of
this sweep to swap.

**Band, labelled as interpolation:** +15 to +60 across the seven proof
boards, concentrated where the gap is widest. NOT the 937 -- most of
those instances are genuinely too large, and the openstacks receipt was
at 89 % precisely because it was close. Rows recovered here are
certified optima, which is why a smaller band than Lane A's is worth
more: on a proof track, coverage IS proof rate.

**Why it is the right headline for this cycle.** The optimality boards
are the weakest coverage in the table (20-38 %). Every other lane this
cycle aims at boards already above 60 %. And the 0.27 engine work has
now twice been told the same thing by measurement -- the relaxation floor
is the term, not the scan -- so a cycle that keeps pushing per-evaluation
speed is a cycle arguing with its own instrument.

### Lane A' — RECORDED NEGATIVE, 2026-09-16. The premise was a mislabel.

Nothing was measured against the cap, because the cap was not what stopped
these rows. `api.rs` built its node-cap note from `inconclusive()`, the same
constructor the clock trip uses, and never read `clock_tripped`, so **every
optimal row the 60 s wall stopped was banked as "node cap reached"**. The
air27 times had already said so. On the four target boards, 545 of the 625
"capped" rows ran ≥ 57 s and none ran under 50 s; across all seven boards
14 of 937 ran under 50 s, and none under 40 s. The early exits are the
teardown reserve (stored bytes / 4e8 s), not the cap.

**The probe.** 26 of the 937 rows (4 per board, evenly spaced; 2 more
could not be located), re-run with the fixed note (`engine-0.28` 5c94647),
`FF_WALL_DEBUG` for the cap and its per-node model, and
`/usr/bin/time -l` for the peak footprint, with the box shared with the
backfill:

- **26 of 26 stopped at the wall. 0 hit the cap. 0 raised it.**
- Headroom was large everywhere: agricola-opt i1 expanded 234 k nodes
  against a 13.8 M cap (250 MB); barman-2014-opt i1 5.0 M against 18.6 M
  (2.0 GB).
- Where memory was heavy, nothing suggests the model over-charges.
  fo-farmland i19's whole process peaked at 4.89 GB before reaching its
  cap, which is MORE than the 3.87 GB the model charges for a full cap
  (9.76 M × 396 B). factory-robot i14 peaked at 3.96 GB against 3.87 GB
  modelled. The footprint includes the task tables and the open list, so
  this is not a per-node measurement, but the direction is clear. A higher
  cap on the numeric boards would buy swap, not proofs.

The openstacks-16 receipt reads the same way: 0.27 was 89 % through a
proof at the wall, not at the cap. **The ceiling on the proof tracks is the
clock**, so a proof-track lever has to be a cheaper expansion or a better
bound, not a larger cap.

**What stays:** the note fix (5c94647). From the next sweep on, a wall stop
reads `inconclusive: wall reached after N expansions`. The 937 air27 rows
keep their old text, so read them as wall stops.

## Lane B — two cheap claims at the existing 60 s wall

- **The tpp complex-preferences parse.** All 20 rows of
  `tpp-preferences-complex` die `engine-exit-1` at ~0.26 s — the spawn
  floor — in both air25-entries and air26. The domain writes a legal PDDL3
  `preference` inside a durative `:condition`; the parser refuses any
  conjunct head that is not `at`/`over`. Band +3 to +6, sized from this
  engine's own twin (`tpp-metric-time` solves i1–i8 of 40 at the same
  budget on the byte-identical hard goal). **Guaranteed regardless of
  band:** 20 rows leave `engine-reject/error` for a real verdict class —
  the shape the 0.26 mem-cap fix already shipped once. **Open question the
  build must answer first:** if the preference is parsed and then dropped
  downstream, the plans are legal but the METRIC is wrong, which is worse
  than failing loudly. A number the record cannot defend is worse than a
  missing number.
  **BUILT 2026-09-16** (`engine-0.28` 9aabf88). The parser takes
  `(preference name (at start phi))` inside a durative `:condition`, and the
  search drops it. The open question is answered in code: `score_soft`
  binds each durative step's condition preferences and counts one
  violated instance per application (at start before the start happening,
  at end before the end, over all across every state inside the
  interval). The fixtures pin all three timespecs and the forced metric.
  **The board, 20 instances at 60 s, one pass, box shared with the
  backfill: 8 of 20 solve** (i1–i4 in 16–36 s; i5–i8 in 58.6–59.1 s, which
  is on the wall and will not all survive a sweep). The other 12 stop at
  the wall, and none dies engine-exit any more. Honest band: **+4 solid, up
  to +8**, against the +3 to +6 the lane was sized at. No solved plan
  violates p-drive, so the new count reads 0 on every banked row. The
  fixtures, not the board, are what prove the count.
- **The barman optimal gate, no-code arm first.** The 300 s probe proves
  cost 49 at 6,949,349 expansions in 50.4 s of user time; the 60 s board
  rows node-cap at 6.4M expansions in 57 s — short of a certificate the
  same engine completes. Every knob is already an env var. Measure both
  arms solo, then **measure the loss side nobody has measured**: sweep the
  four optimal boards at the changed margin and count the rows lost where
  the gate currently fires inside the old band. Ships only as a changed
  default with an `FF_NO_*` restore. Band +1 to +3, **and a net negative
  is possible.**

## Lane C — two probes, both expected negative

- **Floor-tile's dead-end test.** Specified with a verbatim numeric exit
  clause since 0.26 and never run; `grep FF_DEADEND crates/` returns
  nothing after three cycles. Re-anchor its counters (0.27 moved them) and
  re-take the row set against the 0.27 binary before a line is written.
- **A classical `best_h` trace.** There is no h-descent trace on the
  classical path at all — the 138-row AIBR constituency named in the
  0.26 dossier has never been measured for flat h. One print site fixes
  that, and it is what makes the next cycle's numeric-h question askable.

## Lane D — the per-call budget (unscoped, consumer-driven; SHIPPED IN 0.27.1)

Not on the cycle plan. A consumer embedding ferroplan as a library filed a
concrete ask with a measurement attached, and the measurement is why it
jumped the queue: `solve` was blocking and uninterruptible, so a host that
abandoned the work leaked that thread for the life of the process. Their
own instrumentation recorded 213 solves completed, then 2 abandoned, after
which the pool was dead — 0 completed, 4 abandoned.

Neither existing budget could bound one call. `max_evaluated` caps
evaluated STATES and grounding runs before the first state exists;
`FF_TIME_LIMIT` is armed once per PROCESS from the first solve, so in a
long-lived host it either bounds nothing or eventually refuses
everything.

**Shipped as 0.27.1, not here.** Two fields on `Options`, both `None` by
default and inert unless set: `wall_ms` (armed at the top of `solve`, so
it bounds parsing and grounding too) and `should_continue` (an
`Arc<AtomicBool>` polled wherever the wall is). A stop returns
`solved: false` with a note naming which budget bound and where, never
the word "unsolvable".

It went out as a patch release on the 0.27 line rather than waiting for
this cycle **because it is additive API with no engine change** — so it
needed no sweep, and holding it would have kept a blocked consumer
waiting on Lane A's measurement for no reason. The two commits were
cherry-picked; the rest of this branch stayed behind until it has been
measured. That is the precedent worth keeping: API that cannot move a
number does not need a cut behind it.

Held per call in a thread-local armed by an RAII guard, so concurrent
solves carry their own and a spent budget cannot leak into the next call
on its thread. `FF_NO_RUNG_WALLCAP` does not disable it — that hatch
governs the env wall, and a budget passed in code outranks an environment
variable.

**Recorded, not acted on:** the rung ladder rations a wall across its
rungs, so a budget is not "time until I stop". A 30-block instance
solving in 34 ms unbudgeted is stopped by a 120 ms wall and solved under a
200 ms one — and `FF_TIME_LIMIT=0.12` fails the same instance while `0.2`
solves it, so this is the env wall's behaviour too, not the new path's.
Teaching the ladder to skip its slicing under small budgets would be a
behaviour change with no measurement behind it.

### Lane C — the classical `best_h` trace, BUILT 2026-09-16

`FF_HTRACE=1` prints `htrace: best_h H at N evaluated (T s)` on stderr each
time the classical weighted-best-first search improves its best h. That is
the site `advance` already records; the trace adds the evaluation count and
the clock. Off by default and silent. The trace has not been read on the
AIBR constituency yet; that read is the probe.

## The SGPlan question, recorded rather than scoped

The operator's standing goal is to beat SGPlan5, and the record's ledger
is the place that fight is scored: metric-time 64/200 vs 151/200,
complex-pref 26/108 vs 105/108, qualitative 46/100 vs 100/100,
propositional 188/220 like-for-like vs 218/220, constraints 20/80 vs
47/80 — against `time`, which this engine now **leads** (88/130 vs 80/130).

Two facts change how that gap should be read, and both are already
measured:

- **On the instances both solve, ferroplan wins on quality**, often by a
  wide margin (qualitative rovers: 68 vs 88, 26.1 vs 43.4, 37.6 vs 88,
  556 vs 674 — lower is better), and the ESPC penalty loop is why
  (`FF_NO_ESPC=1` degrades the same instances to 23/24/29/39/66/65/126/370
  against 19/23/17/16/21/22/66/87). The gap is **coverage**, not quality
  and not a missing mechanism.
- **SGPlan5's numbers were measured at IPC-5's 30-minute limit**; ours are
  at 60 seconds. The published gap therefore overstates the deficit by an
  unknown amount.

### The parity probe, RUN 2026-09-18/19. The gap is 76 rows, not 125.

Both boards at IPC-5's own 1800 s limit, once, as a MEASUREMENT: no board
bought, no table changed. Only instances UNSOLVED at the 60 s wall were
re-run (a 60 s solve is a 1800 s solve), 128 of them, packed for coverage
with timing dirty by construction. Raws:
`benchmarks/probes-0.28/sgplan-parity-1800s.txt` and the two jsonl beside
it. Engine: `engine-0.28` at e42c30c, so the complex board includes the
Lane B tpp fix.

| board | 60 s | 1800 s | total | SGPlan5 | gap at 60 s | gap at 1800 s |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ipc5-qual-pref | 51 | **76** | 100 | 100 | 49 | **24** |
| ipc5-complex-pref | 29 | **53** | 108 | 105 | 76 | **52** |

**Half the qualitative gap and a third of the complex one were the wall.**
49 new solves for 128 instance-runs. By domain: rovers +9, storage +7,
tpp +5, openstacks +2, trucks +2 (qualitative); pathways +14, tpp +8,
pipesworld +1, storage +1 (complex).

**The finding that matters is not the count, it is the SHAPE.** 14 of the
49 landed within 300 s and three within 60 s — rovers-qual i5 in 40 s, on
an instance the 60 s board misses. Those are not instances that needed 30
minutes of search. The rung ladder rations one wall across its rungs
(Lane D recorded the same behaviour from the other side: a 34 ms instance
fails under a 120 ms budget and solves under 200 ms), so at 60 s the
ladder never reaches the rung that solves them. **A cheaper lever than any
preferences wing is the ladder's slicing policy**, and it is now measured
rather than asserted.

**A defect this probe found, worth its own lane.** The 21 instances that
banked `mem-cap` at 60 s were re-run one and two at a time. Under a
declared `FF_MEM_BUDGET_GB=6` each grew to **~528 GB of virtual address
space with 20 MB resident** while system swap reached **44 GB** — 28
minutes at 0.1 % CPU, thrashing rather than searching, until the external
alarm. One of them (storage-complex i2) still solved, at 1803 s, so the
class is not hopeless; but the internal node cap plainly does not hold
this class to its declared budget at a long wall. At 60 s the runner's RSS
watchdog hides it. 0.22's sailing-wind receipt describes the same
pathology and the cap was supposed to have fixed it.

**What the probe does NOT license.** 76/100 and 53/108 are 1800 s numbers
against SGPlan5's 1800 s numbers; the published table stays at 60 s. The
remaining 76 rows across both boards are a real capability gap, and a
preferences wing would still be pricing itself against that, not against
the 125 the old reading implied.

### CORRECTION, 2026-09-19: the probe ran six threads, the boards run one

`probe.sh` invoked `ff` with no `--threads` flag, so the probe took the
auto thread count — `min(cores, 6)`, and `statistics.threads: 6` on a
re-run confirms it. Every published row on both boards is `threads: 1`
(all 208 of them, `benchmarks/ipc5-qual-pref.jsonl` and
`ipc5-complex-pref.jsonl`). The probe bought ~30× wall AND 6× cores at
once, so its rows are not like-for-like with the 60 s board, and not with
SGPlan5's single-core 1800 s results either.

The three fastest new solves, re-run SINGLE-THREADED at the same 1800 s
wall, same binary, same box:

| witness | probe, 6 threads | re-run, 1 thread | 60 s board |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| tpp-preferences-complex i1 | 40 s | 82 s | unsolved |
| tpp-preferences-complex i2 | 56 s | 115 s | unsolved |
| rovers-preferences-qualitative i5 | 40 s | 457 s | unsolved |

**WITHDRAWN: "three within 60 s", and the slicing lever it motivated.**
Single-threaded, the three need 82 s, 115 s and 457 s. None is reachable
inside the board's 60 s wall under ANY slicing policy, because the WORK
exceeds the wall — there is no rung left to give it to. The ratios share
no constant (2.05×, 2.05×, 11.4×), so the probe's remaining times cannot
be rescaled to a single-threaded estimate: the 49-solve table is a
6-thread table, and the honest single-threaded gap is somewhere between
76 and 125 rows, unmeasured.

**Also withdrawn: the mechanism.** These two boards never enter the
sliced ladder at all. `FF_WALL_DEBUG=1` on a qualitative-preferences
solve prints NOTHING (`mode: pddl3`) — the preference path runs
`pddl3::metric_optimize`'s restart ladder over `PROFILES` against a flat
2,000,000-eval `pref_eval_budget()`, which is wall-blind. Whatever the
60 s wall costs these boards, "the rung ladder rations one wall across
its rungs" is not a description of it.

**What survives.** 49 of 128 previously-unsolved instances do solve given
1800 s and six cores — true, as SIX-THREAD numbers, and worth what that
is worth. The mem-cap defect below is untouched: it was diagnosed from
address space and swap, not from timing. What is gone is the
like-for-like reading, and the cheap lever it implied.

### The 49, reclassified — 8 of them were never a wall result

Zero box time: join the probe's 128 rows against the committed 60 s raws
on `(variant, instance)` and read what the 60 s row actually SAID.

| the 60 s row said | count | what the 1800 s solve means |
|---|---:|---|
| plain timeout | 38 | genuine extra compute (wall AND cores) |
| `engine-exit-1` | **8** | the 60 s row was a CRASH, not a timeout |
| `mem-cap` | 3 | the memory class, re-run 1- and 2-wide |

The 8 `engine-exit-1` rows are tpp — **the Lane B parse fix, already
banked in this cycle**. Their 60 s rows record `rc=1` because the engine
died on the parse; the probe re-ran them with the fixed engine and scored
the conversion a second time, as a wall result. The probe's own write-up
says "the tpp contributions only exist because of the Lane B parse fix"
and then counts them anyway. Deduct them: the wall-and-cores conversion
is 41 rows, not 49, and on ipc5-complex-pref it is 16, not 24.

**Owed before any SGPlan claim, and cheap: one parity probe.** Run the
qualitative and complex boards at 1800 s, once, as a MEASUREMENT and not a
tier — it answers whether the fight is 54 rows or 5. The standing anti-pot
against new tiers is about *published* tiers; this buys no board and
changes no table. Until that number exists, an SGPlan wing is unpriced,
and this project has three cycles of evidence that bands taken from other
planners' published results deliver +1.

### The timing read, 2026-09-20. SGPlan5's median solve is 0.54 s.

Everything above argues about the WALL. `benchmarks/IPC5-results.tgz` has
held the answer the whole time: every SGPlan5 `.soln` carries a `; Time`
header, its own CPU seconds on 2006 hardware. Joined per instance against
the 60 s boards (`benchmarks/probes-0.28/sgplan-timing/join.py`), like-for-
like variants only:

| | |
|---|---:|
| SGPlan5 solves across the seven IPC-5 boards | 860 |
| ... finished inside 1 s / 10 s / 60 s | 480 (55 %) / 668 (77 %) / 769 (89 %) |
| ... median | **0.54 s** |
| rows SGPlan5 solves and this engine does not | 335 |
| ... that took SGPlan5 under 60 s / under 1 s | **283 / 143** |

**The "their 1800 s against our 60 s" reading explains at most 52 rows.**
`pathways-metric-time`: this engine 0/30 at 60 s, SGPlan5 30/30 with a
median of 0.22 s and a maximum of 1.1 s. `tpp-metric-time-constraints`:
0/30 against a median of 0.01 s. A planner that answers in a hundredth of a
second is not out-searching anything. It is not searching.

**Also corrected: the quality claim above.** "On the instances both solve,
ferroplan wins on quality" is true of the rovers rows it quotes and of
storage; across the boards it is a split, and on simple-preferences it is
the other way round (SGPlan5 better on 70 of 118, ferroplan on 29, by
SGPlan5's self-reported `MetricValue`; qualitative 26–22 to ferroplan;
complex 20–8 to SGPlan5). The margins are small where this engine loses
(tpp 129 vs 105) and large where it wins (storage 25 vs 87), but "coverage,
not quality" was half right.

**What the unsolved rows were actually doing** (`why.py`, the 60 s raws'
own notes column): stopping at the wall inside the decision-epoch ladder
(~117), exhausting the temporal ladder's budgets with wall to spare (33),
`mem-cap` three to ten seconds in (29), the Lane B parse crash (20), and a
plain 60 s timeout inside the PDDL3 optimizer (~120). Three probes, each
threads 1 / 60 s / single attempt / VAL-judged against the ORIGINAL task /
counted only under 58 s (`satprobe.py`, `tprobe.py`, `tally.txt`):

| lever | what the probe ran | rows converted |
|---|---|---:|
| the PDDL3 route has no first plan | `ff --satisfice` on the rows the optimizer timed out on | **60** (qual 51 → 97 of 100; simple 119 → 130 of 130) |
| the temporal ladder has no sequential rung | durative → one classical action, plan, lay out end to end (`compress.py`) | **121** (complex-pref 29 → 82; metric-time 44 → 89; time 53 → 76) |
| the preference tier overruns its own wall | (found while probing) a banked, valid plan returned at 21.94 s of a 20 s wall | folded into the two above |

Six boards, **319 → 500 against SGPlan5's 612**, from levers that are
architecture rather than search. One shape under all three: **a valid plan
was in hand, or milliseconds away, and the route had no way to return it.**
SGPlan5 is "feasible first, better second" all the way down. This engine
was "best or nothing", with the wall deciding which.

**What is left after them is real engine work, and it is numeric.** The
compressed `rovers-metric-time` runs ~210 evaluations a second against
>5,000 for its same-size propositional twin (`heuristic.rs::build_rpg`
widens intervals layer by layer -- a hypothesis, not a profile). And
`tpp-metric-time` i9 is 20 facts and 264 ops on which the classical ladder
spends 5,000,000 evaluations without a plan -- the one place SGPlan's per-goal
partitioning is doing the work its name claims. (`--mode partition` does
engage here; what it lacks is scoped below.) Worth noticing on the way
past: the decision-epoch search's demand tiers guide numeric accumulation
BETTER than the classical relaxation does (a mini-pathways task the
compressed search fails on for 32 s solves there in 40 ms). That is ~112
rows and the next cycle's question; the propositional board (231 vs 248)
is untouched by any of this.

## Lanes S, I, T, N and M — feasible first (BUILT 2026-09-20/21)

Built in cost order on `engine-0.28`. Fixtures first where a fixture can be
RED at unit scale; where the defect is a scale phenomenon, the fixture pins
the mechanism and the RED receipt is a named board row.

### Lane S — a banked plan is reported inside the wall (`ac99b41`)

`temporal::solve`'s preference tiers already banked coverage first. They
then chased quality against the SAME wall, the ladder under the chase opened
further rungs (each re-grounding) after the wall had expired, and the caller
grounded the original pair a second time to score whatever came back --
12.7 s on `pathways-complex` i20, all of it past the deadline. The runner
kills at the wall.

- `search::tighten_deadline`: a scoped deadline riding the per-call budget
  every checkpoint already joins. `reserve_for_report` holds back 3 % of the
  wall's TOTAL (0.5–3 s) plus `ops / 1e5` s for closing and dropping a big
  task. (The first cut read the REMAINING wall; after a 30 s grounding that
  is 0.9 s, and `storage-qualitative` i20 exited at 60.2.)
- `score_soft` splits into `SoftScorer::prepare` (the grounding) and
  `::score` (a replay): the scorer is built BEFORE the chase, under the same
  tightened deadline, so the winning plan is one replay from its report. A
  banked plan whose scorer cannot be built in time is reported UNSCORED,
  with a note -- a plan without a metric is a solve; a plan never printed is
  not.
- `solve_ladder` refuses the Full tier and the decomposer rung once the wall
  is spent.
- `tests/pref_chase_wall.rs`: the `tsearch_wall` ring with its unreachable
  goal moved into a preference, plus a K³ ballast action so grounding costs
  real time. **v0.27.1: reported at 6.523 s of a 6 s wall. Now inside it.**

### Lane I — incumbent zero (`5bfa26e`)

The compiled preference task prices every preference into the goal and
rides a monitor block on every op, so its FIRST plan is far dearer than the
hard goals' plan. `rovers-qualitative` i9: 70k evaluations at ~3,600/s and a
whole 20 s wall without reaching the hard goal once; the classical ladder
reaches it in 133 evaluations and 30 ms. `metric_optimize` returned `None`
and the route said "unsolved" (the text path said "proven unsolvable").

- `pddl3::hard_goal_seed` plans the ORIGINAL pair and lifts the plan into
  the compiled task by display name (precondition-preference variants share
  a name and are mutually exclusive; the trajectory gate's `TRAJ-END` is a
  real op to both). `close_seed` closes it with the phase tail.
- `metric_optimize_seeded` uses it as a **floor, not a bound**: the B&B runs
  exactly as it did -- the `ipc5_*_metric_no_regression` and
  `reported_equals_verified` locks pass unchanged -- and the seed comes back
  only when nothing cheaper was found, with a note saying so.
  `FF_PREF_SEED_BOUND=1` also opens the B&B with it; `FF_PREF_NO_SEED=1` is
  the 0.27 restore.
- **The seed ladder gets the whole wall.** Handed 80 % of it, EHC's
  proportional slice is 12 s and `rovers-qualitative` i20 -- which EHC solves
  at 14.6 s -- is handed down the ladder and lost. This is Lane W's
  pathology met from the other side, and the second receipt for it.
- A plan in hand still has to cross the wire, and the optimizer had four
  ways to miss: the best-first loop read the clock once per 256-eval batch
  (two seconds at the 8 ms an evaluation costs on a compiled task; and on
  wide states EXPANSION is the slow half -- one batch, 2.3 s); the selection
  DFS's node cap is wall-blind and every node scans all the preferences
  (~15 s on `storage-qualitative` i17's 23k instances, for a result the
  caller discards as "capped"); and the B&B loops, the selection probes and
  the legacy fallback kept opening one-evaluation sweeps after the wall.
  All four now read an armed deadline. A tripped batch is a capped return
  that never looks at its values, so a run that ends inside the wall is
  evaluation-for-evaluation what it was.
- `tests/pref_seed.rs` pins the lift through both places the op sets differ,
  and the floor's exact price. The RED receipts are board rows:

  | row | wall | 0.27.1 | now (process exit) |
  |---|---:|---|---|
  | rovers-qual i9 | 20 s | unsolved | solved, 19.88 s |
  | rovers-qual i20 | 60 s | unsolved | solved, 58.16 s |
  | storage-qual i20 | 60 s | unsolved | solved, 57.95 s, metric 5737 < floor 6046 |
  | rovers-qual i1 | 20 s | metric 68.039 | 68.039 |

### Lane T — the compression rung (`tcompress.rs`)

Every durative action becomes one instantaneous action (condition = start ∧
over-all ∧ end; effect = start then end, a token added at start and deleted
at end netting to its delete), the classical ladder plans it, and a
left-shift over the ops' read/write sets puts the plan back on the clock.
`temporal::validate` judges the result against the original pair before
anyone sees it. Declines required concurrency (the existing detector), timed
initial literals and trajectory constraints.

- **It banks; the decision-epoch ladder then runs as a bounded quality
  chase, and the smaller makespan is returned.** The left-shift is coarse
  (whole-op interference) and the ladder's plans are much better where it
  has one -- `openstacks-time` i5: 343 against the rung's 897 -- so a row the
  ladder already solved keeps its plan, byte for byte, and a row it never
  solved has one.
- **The bet is bounded in both regimes.** Under a wall, a quarter of what is
  left (`FF_TCOMPRESS_WALL_FRAC`); unwalled, 2,000 evaluations per classical
  rung -- the first cut had no unwalled bound and spent 32 s failing on a
  task the ladder below solves in 40 ms. A ladder that then finds nothing
  leaves the rung a second, unbounded attempt.
- **The validator had to be fixed twice to be usable here.** It fired ends
  before starts inside one epoch, which put a ZERO-DURATION step's end ahead
  of its own start: every plan through pathways' dur-0 `choose` /
  `initialize` was refused (`temporal::epoch_rank`; the search and VAL both
  order the pair start-then-end). And it grounds the full snap task it
  replays on, which for `pipesworld-metric-time` is the very blow-up the
  board records as `mem-cap` -- i20's plan is found in 4 s and its validation
  was still grounding 96 s later. The rung validates at the PLAN's size: the
  domain specialised to one parameterless durative action per ground step.
  `tests/tcompress.rs` cross-checks that against the full validator.
- An engine-semantics note, found by the fixture and NOT changed: the snap
  compile asks for the over-all invariant in the START snap's precondition,
  which is stricter than PDDL2.1's open interval -- a self-established
  over-all lock is unsolvable here by rule. The rung follows the engine's
  rule (it only relaxes self-established AT-END conditions).
- `tests/tcompress.rs`: a held token nets to its release; independent work
  overlaps and interference does not; zero-duration steps validate; the
  three declines; and, `#[ignore]`d, `pathways-metric-time` p01 -- an 18-step
  plan the ladder cannot find (its dur-0 happenings pile up at t = 0 and the
  search permutes them to its node caps), the whole domain 0/30 on the 0.27
  board.

### Lane N — a dead end is a fixpoint, not a 2,000-layer grind (`heuristic.rs`)

Item four on the list was "profile the numeric RPG", on the hypothesis that
`build_rpg` widens intervals layer by layer. The profile said otherwise: a
live state's build is 4-5 layers and ~100 µs. The cost is the DEAD ENDS.

The fixpoint test was "did any relevant bound move this layer", and with a
consumable that is true for ever: every applied `(decrease (energy ?r) 8)`
pushes energy's LOWER bound down another 8 each layer, while the only thing
that reads energy is `(>= (energy ?r) 8)` -- its UPPER bound. So a state
whose goal no layer will ever reach was never seen to be a fixpoint; the
build ran to `LAYER_CAP`, 2,000 layers re-widening thousands of applied ops,
and then reported the same "unreachable" a fixpoint would have. On the
compressed `rovers-metric-time` i20 the MEAN build was 120-236 layers.

`NeedDirs`: which SIDE of each fluent anything reads -- `num_sat`'s table for
conditions, `widen`'s for effects, closed to a fixpoint -- computed lazily at
layer 16, so an ordinary build never pays for it. From there a layer counts
as progress only if a fact, an op, or a NEEDED bound moved. The bounds
themselves widen exactly as before, so this is exact, not approximate:
every reachable state evaluates to the same h, and a build this ends early
could only have ended at the cap with the goal unreached.
`FF_NO_NEED_DIRS=1` restores the old test.

| compressed rovers-metric-time, evaluations in a 30 s wall | old | new |
|---|---:|---:|
| i6 | 25,866 | **2,026,337** (78x) |
| i14 | 9,115 | **717,264** (79x) |
| i20 | 0 (EHC never finished a slice) | 49,380 |

Identity: 123 of 123 corpus numeric instances (ipc-2023n, the 2002/2006/2008
numeric and metric tracks; 20k-eval cap, unwalled) report the same solved
flag, evaluation count and plan length with the hatch on and off; the two
unit pins hold their exact layer counts (`GoalAt(3)`, `GoalAt(100)`) either
way, and the dead-end pin is `Cap` under the hatch and `Fixpoint` without.

**What it did NOT do is solve those rows.** With evaluations 78x cheaper,
`rovers-metric-time` i6 descends best-h 28 -> 11 in a third of a second and
then sits at 11 for 900,000 evaluations: the relaxation cannot see energy
being spent, so a state with too little left looks as good as any other.
That is guidance, not speed, and it is the same residue as `tpp` -- numeric
goals and consumables want SGPlan's per-goal partitioning (or a resource-
aware relaxation), and neither is built. A NEEDED bound that grows for ever
(any task with a recharge in play) still runs a dead end to the cap; that
wants saturation at the largest value anything compares against, and is
also not built.

### Numeric-goal partitioning — LOOKED AT, NOT BUILT

Item five. The probe's note that `--mode partition` "evaluates zero states on
a numeric goal" was a misreading of the JSON (the partition path reports 0
evaluations by construction). It engages, and what it does on the compressed
`tpp-metric-time` i9 -- 20 facts, 264 ops, nine goals `(>= (stored g) (request
g))` -- is the scoping for the next cycle (`FF_WALL_DEBUG=1`, 40 s wall):

- Seven of the nine single-goal subproblems solve, 5-7 ops each -- at **~1.7 s
  apiece**, because a subgoal solve is bare weighted best-first under a
  100k-evaluation cap and the relaxation is nearly blind to quantities. There
  is no EHC and no helpful-action pruning on the subgoal path; FF's speed on
  exactly this shape is those two things.
- The two large requests (29 and 20 units: two markets' worth, so repeated
  buy/load/unload cycles) are **unsolvable in isolation** at that cap.
- Every merge **re-solves every group from the initial state**, including
  the seven that did not change: 15 s of Phase A per merge, and the wall is
  gone after the second.

So SGPlan's decomposition is the right shape for this family and the engine
already has the loop; what it lacks is a subplanner that is good at ONE
numeric goal. In order of cost: keep Phase A's subplans across a merge
(only the merged group changed); give the subgoal path the EHC-first ladder
the monolithic path has; then the relaxation's view of consumables (Lane N's
residue, the same thing seen from the other side). Not built this cycle --
each of those moves every numeric board and wants its own sit.

### The board sit

`benchmarks/probes-0.28/lanes-sit/run.sh`: the six IPC-5 boards these lanes
were built for, and the two temporal boards they were NOT built for
(`tempo-sat`, `tempo-sat-2014` -- the regression read: the rung touches every
temporal task without required concurrency). One attempt per row, 2-wide,
threads 1, 60 s, against the PUBLISHED boards, which are best-of-N -- so a
single attempt is the conservative side of every delta, and a row the new
engine loses is re-run on the old binary under the same conditions before it
is called a loss. **Estimator declared in advance: first attempt.**

**Sit 1 (`759b55f`), stopped after its first board.** `ipc5-qual-pref`:
**51 → 93, +42, 0 lost** (SGPlan5: 100) -- first attempt, VAL-checked,
through the board harness. The probe had said 97. Raws in
`lanes-sit/sit-1-759b55f/`. From its eighth minute the box was also running
a game at ~210 % CPU, so that is a DEGRADED reading and the conservative side
of one.

The seven misses were all the LARGEST instances (rovers i20, storage 17-20,
trucks 10/16), every one killed at exactly 60 s, and they were worth stopping
for. Solo on a quiet box they exit at ~58 s; two-wide, or beside anything
else, their wall-blind stretches grow past the kill line with a valid plan
already in hand. What that turned up, in the order found:

- The reserve is now 3 % of the wall + `ops / 1e5` s **+ 5 % of the wall
  already spent**, and an optimizer reached with more than two thirds of the
  wall gone reports incumbent zero instead of starting.
- **The hard goals' plan is found BEFORE the compiled task is grounded**
  (`hard_goal_plan` / `lift_seed`), and a compiled grounding that stops at
  the wall now returns that plan UNPRICED, with a note, where it returned
  "grounding stopped at the declared budget". JSON path only; the text path
  still prints the grounding-wall line.
- **A flat conjunction was grounded in quadratic time.** `and_merge` builds a
  1 x 1 product by CLONING the accumulated conjunct, so an n-atom goal merged
  one atom at a time copies 1 + 2 + ... + n literals -- and the compiled task's
  goal has one `P3COLLECTED` atom per live preference: 37,201 on
  `storage-qualitative` i20, ~700M literal copies, **25 s of a 60 s wall**.
  The DNF wall check counts CONJUNCTS and this shape only ever produces one,
  so not one clock read in all that time. `and_merge_owned` appends in
  place: the same conjunct, literal for literal, in the same order.
- Grounding below the binding enumeration had no checkpoints at all. It has
  coarse ones now, between phases (`GroundWall::expired_now`;
  `FF_GROUND_PHASES=1` prints each phase's clock).
- **Found, NOT fixed -- the next thing in the way:** with the DNF fixed, the
  long phase is `packing the ops`: every monitored op is pushed onto the
  achiever list of every fact the SHARED monitor block adds, so the index is
  ops x monitor-adds -- hundreds of millions of `u32`s on these instances, 46 s
  of `storage-qualitative` i19 on the loaded box, and gigabytes. The shared
  block exists so that cost is paid once; the achiever index un-shares it.
  This is very likely the `mem-cap` class as well (storage-complex 18 rows,
  pipesworld-metric-time 8), and it wants achiever lookup to understand
  "every monitored op" without materialising it.

**Sit 2 (`424843b`), the six IPC-5 boards -- DONE.** First attempt, two-wide,
threads 1, 60 s, VAL-checked, against the PUBLISHED boards (best-of-N):

| board | rows | published | sit 2 | delta | lost |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ipc5-qual-pref | 100 | 51 | **99** | +48 | 0 |
| ipc5-simple-pref | 130 | 119 | **130** | +11 | 0 |
| ipc5-complex-pref | 108 | 29 | **74** | +45 | 0 |
| ipc5-time | 130 | 88 | **126** | +38 | 0 |
| ipc5-metric-time | 200 | 64 | **100** | +36 | 1 |
| ipc5-constraints | 120 | 28 | 28 | 0 | 0 |
| **six boards** | **788** | **379** | **557** | **+178** | **1** |

The same raws, restricted to the variants SGPlan5 actually ran -- the ledger
this cycle's question was asked on:

| board | rows | 0.27 published | sit 2 | SGPlan5 | gap was | gap now |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ipc5-simple-pref | 130 | 119 | **130** | 129 | 10 | **-1** |
| ipc5-qual-pref | 100 | 51 | **99** | 100 | 49 | 1 |
| ipc5-complex-pref | 108 | 29 | 74 | 105 | 76 | 31 |
| ipc5-time | 80 | 53 | 76 | 80 | 27 | 4 |
| ipc5-metric-time | 180 | 44 | 80 | 151 | 107 | 71 |
| ipc5-constraints | 80 | 20 | 20 | 47 | 27 | 27 |
| **six boards** | **678** | **316** | **479** | **612** | **296** | **133** |

The probe said 500; the boards say 479 (complex-pref 74 where the probe had
82, metric-time 80 where it had 89 -- the rung's first bet is a quarter of the
wall, where the probe gave the classical search all of it). simple-pref is
past SGPlan5 and qual-pref is one row short of it. What is left is where this
section said it would be: `tpp-*` and `rovers-metric-time` (numeric
guidance), `constraints` (the rung declines them, and `within` needs a
clock), and the `mem-cap` class.

**The one lost row** is `tpp-metric-time` i8 (published solved at 14.35 s by
the decision-epoch ladder). It is the predicted shape: the rung's bet fails on
`tpp`, costs its quarter of the wall, and the ladder starts 15 s late. Under
the load the box was carrying when it was re-run, 0.27.1 fails it too (0 of 2
on each binary, `differential-ipc5-under-load.json`), so it is OWED a quiet
re-run and is not yet called either way. Its three late-solving siblings (i5,
i6, i7: 56-59 s published) were all RETAINED, at 41-45 s.

Box conditions, from `run.log`: `mediaanalysisd` at ~200-285 % CPU at the
start of three of the six boards (macOS's idle-time photo analysis), a browser
at the start of two; the box was otherwise quiet. The two temporal boards
below ran beside a full Bevy build from another project (load average 23), so
their read leans entirely on the differential.



### The regression read, THROUGH THE CRUCIBLE (2026-09-20, `crucible-spec.md` R3)

The ad-hoc sit above was stopped at its seventh board: the operator had been
playing a game beside it, then building another project at load 23, and a
shell loop around `ipc67.py` has no way to know. That is what the crucible
is for, and it could not be aimed at a subset -- so it was taught to
(`crucible sweep --board/--only/--rows/--prior --engine`, `compare --lost`;
commit `e17fa2a`). Everything from here is measured through it.

The question: the compression rung touches every temporal task without
required concurrency, including the two boards it was NOT built for. Does it
cost a row? Both engines over the SAME cells -- the 519 temporal cells the
published `ipc67-temporal` and `ipc2014-tempo` solved -- same referee, same
box, same retry rule: equal-N by construction.

| board | cells | v0.27.1 `d812c232` | candidate `c0893fb8` | lost | gained |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ipc2014-tempo | 78 | 78 | 78 | 0 | 0 |
| ipc67-temporal | 441 | 441 | 441 | 0 | 0 |

**519 of 519 on both engines. The rung costs no row.** Summed solve time is
0.91x the baseline's (26.5 min against 29.1) and the median is identical
(0.26 s); makespan is BETTER on 181 cells, equal on 286 and worse on 6,
because a task the rung banks returns the smaller of its left-shifted plan
and the ladder's. (The 6 are cells the ladder did not reach inside its
bounded chase.) The candidate arm took 4.4 h of wall to the baseline's
55 min -- the box was POLITE for most of it (foreign load 44-225 %), the
crucible demoted the planners and kept measuring, and every row banked in
one pass. `match-cellar` reads 2.5x slower in that arm and is not: the rung
declines it (required concurrency, cost 0) and solo it solves in 14.3 s, as
it did. Dirty timing, clean coverage -- spec §7, doing its job.

Receipts: `benchmarks/probes-0.28/lanes-crucible/` (`run.sh`, the three logs,
`regress-compare.txt`); the staged raws are in the published checkout under
`benchmarks/probes/lanes-0.28-regress/`.

### The six IPC-5 boards, THROUGH THE CRUCIBLE -- and what it found

Step 3 of `probes-0.28/lanes-crucible/run.sh`: candidate `c0893fb8`, 788
cells **banked in 4 passes** -- the rows the referee judged contended were
re-run on their own, which is the whole of the operator's ask. Against the
published boards (best-of-N), with the hand-rolled sit beside it:

| board | rows | published | crucible | delta | lost | (ad-hoc sit 2) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ipc5-simple-pref | 130 | 119 | 129 | +10 | 1 | 130 |
| ipc5-qual-pref | 100 | 51 | 95 | +44 | 0 | 99 |
| ipc5-complex-pref | 108 | 29 | 76 | +47 | 0 | 74 |
| ipc5-time | 130 | 88 | 126 | +38 | 0 | 126 |
| ipc5-metric-time | 200 | 64 | 92 | +28 | 0 | 100 |
| ipc5-constraints | 120 | 28 | 28 | 0 | 0 | 28 |
| **six boards** | **788** | **379** | **546** | **+167** | **1** | 557 |

Like-for-like against SGPlan5 (the variants it ran): **316 -> 468 of 678**
against its 612 -- the gap is 144, was 296. `ipc5-tally.txt` has both tables.

**+167, not +178, and the eleven are one defect.** Every cell the crucible
read lower than the sit -- fifteen of them -- came back `mem-cap`: the
manifest gives a run 6 GB where the sit's harness default gave 8. (It also
read four cells HIGHER, `tpp-metric-time` i8 among them: the sit's one "lost"
row solves at 28.7 s on a fair run, as predicted -- 15 s of rung, 14 s of
ladder. The one row lost here, `openstacks-preferences-simple` i13, is one of
the fifteen.) And every one of the fifteen had its plan ALREADY FOUND when
the watchdog killed it: ten `pipesworld-metric-time` rows the compression
rung banks in seconds, killed in the snap grounding of the quality chase
that follows; four `storage-qualitative` rows killed grounding the compiled
task that only PRICES the plan. Dying of memory with a plan in hand is Lane
S's sin with a different resource.

### Lane M — memory is a wall too (`mem.rs`)

The engine has always had a memory MODEL (bytes per node x nodes, against
60 % of the declared budget) and never a MEASUREMENT -- and the model is what
this roadmap keeps recording as wrong for exactly these classes (528 GB of
address space under a declared 6; "the internal node cap plainly does not
hold"). `mem::resident_bytes()` asks the kernel (`/proc/self/status`;
`task_info` on macOS, declared by hand -- no `libc` dependency, the first
`unsafe` in the crate, eleven lines). `MemWall` is read at the checkpoints
that already exist: the best-first batch boundary, every 256 temporal pops,
every 256 grounding bindings, between grounding phases and inside the
op-packing loop. A trip is an honest capped return, and what was banked is
what comes back. (As first pushed, `5a102b8`, that list had three holes in
it; the crucible found them. See the next section.)

- **Bounded work only.** The first cut armed the wall everywhere, and that
  is a regression waiting to happen: one run in ten over the record peaks
  above 4.4 GB, and a first search stopped at 4.5 of 6 loses the solve it was
  a gigabyte from. The wall arms only inside a `ScopedDeadline`
  (`search::bounded_work`) -- a chase over a banked plan, the grounding that
  prices a plan already found, a rung's bet -- where a trip costs an
  improvement and never a row. `FF_NO_MEM_WALL=1` restores 0.27.
- **75 % of the budget**, not 85: at 0.85 a snap-compiled pipesworld
  grounding tripped at 5.1 GB and still peaked at 5.97 of 6. The runner kills
  AT the budget and a wide task allocates a great deal between two reads.
- **The hard-goal plan is found on the pair with its SOFT constraints
  stripped** (`constraints::hard_only_gated`). A soft constraint cannot make a
  plan invalid, and on the qualitative track the soft monitors are most of
  the task. Safe by construction: monitors ride ops and add none, and
  `TRAJ-END` exists iff the pair has HARD constraints, which the stripped
  pair keeps. (A branch that re-added the latch on lift was written, caught
  by its own fixture as unreachable, and removed.)
- `tests/mem_wall.rs`: the chase ring under a 0.25 GB budget and a long wall.
  **With the wall: back in 0.53 s, peak 209 MB. Hatched to the 0.27 shape: 38.8
  s and 8.2 GB** -- on a sixteen-bit toy. That is the `mem-cap` class in
  miniature, and the second leg is kept as the permanent RED record.

| under `FF_MEM_BUDGET_GB=6`, alone | 0.28 before Lane M | with it |
|---|---|---|
| pipesworld-metric-time i41 | solved, peak **7.91 GB** (a kill) | solved, 11.7 s, peak 4.89 GB |
| openstacks-simple i13 | `mem-cap` | solved, metric 115, peak 4.58 GB |
| storage-qualitative i17 / i18 | `mem-cap` | solved unpriced, peak 5.1 / 5.8 GB |
| storage-qualitative i20 | `mem-cap` | solved unpriced -- **but peak 7.1 GB** |

**Not fixed, and named:** `storage-qualitative` i19/i20 pass 6 GB before any
plan exists and before any checkpoint -- `constraints::expand` materialises
all 2.3 million preference instances and only THEN drops the 98 % that are
statically true. That wants a streaming expansion (simplify each instance as
it is produced), which touches the verifier and the temporal scorer too. Two
rows, and they solve at 8 GB.

### Lane M, read THROUGH THE CRUCIBLE -- a win, a regression, and what the regression was

Two subsets (`crucible-spec.md` R3), same set, same 6 GB cap, same referee --
run twice: on `69471da363ec` (= `5a102b8`, Lane M as first pushed) and, after
what that found, on `62b4f03a51d3` (the fix). Receipts: `probes-0.28/lanes-crucible/`
(`run-mem.sh`, `run-memhigh.sh`, `memcap.rows`, `memhigh.rows`, the two logs,
`memhigh-compare.py`).

**The confirmation: every cell the lanes candidate banked as `mem-cap` on the
six boards -- 54, not just the fifteen the sit had out-read.** 54 banked in two
passes, nine minutes. **16 of 54 now solve, all VAL-valid**:
pipesworld-metric-time 13 of 22, storage-qualitative 2 of 4 (unpriced),
and openstacks-simple i13 -- the one row the candidate had LOST against the
published board -- back at metric 115. The other 38 are `mem-cap` still:
storage-complex 18, storage-time-constraints 8, pipesworld-metric-time 9,
storage-qualitative 2, pipesworld-complex 1. Those hold no plan when the
memory goes, and this wall is deliberately blind there.

**The regression read, and it is why this section exists.** The wall trips at
4.5 GB, so it can only change a cell whose resident set gets there. The
crucible's database names them: `run.peak_rss >= 3.5 GB` and solved, on the
candidate -- 58 cells. Equal-N, one banked row per cell per engine:

| 58 cells the candidate solved at >= 3.5 GB | |
|---|---|
| solved by both | 56 |
| **lost** | **2** -- elevator-strips i30, pipesworld-complex i16, both now `mem-cap` |
| metric priced -> **unpriced** | 4 -- storage-qualitative i15/i16, storage-simple i19/i20 |
| metric worse | 1 (tpp-simple i17, 2409 -> 2411) |
| metric better | 0 |
| summed solve time | 0.78x |

A lane that exists to stop `mem-cap` kills produced two. Neither was what it
looked like:

- **Both cells were ALWAYS over the cap.** Alone, under `/usr/bin/time -l`,
  the 0.27-shaped engine (`FF_NO_MEM_WALL=1`) peaks at **6.59 GB** on
  elevator-strips i30, and pipesworld-complex i16 reaches 6.4 GB inside a
  grounding no wall was armed on (GB here is 2^30, as the manifest's cap is). The candidate's
  banked rows say 4.52 and 5.89 GB because **the crucible's `rss-watchdog`
  SAMPLES**, and a two-second spike fell between two samples. Lane M changed
  the timing (the chase it cut was where the process used to spend its time)
  and the same spike got caught, three attempts in three.
- **And the wall could not see the spike**, for three reasons, each one a
  trace (`rss_trace.py`: stderr lines stamped with the process's RSS):
  1. *No checkpoint inside the interning loop.* `mids` is a second copy of
     every op while `raws` is still alive. elevator-strips i30 -- 3.2 million
     ops -- left the enumeration at 4.3 GB, UNDER the line, and was at 5.7
     before the phase boundary could look.
  2. *A trip was not sticky.* The freed arena goes back to the system, the
     next tier of the chase reads 3.8 GB, grounds again, and climbs again:
     three more tiers, 1.5 s and +0.8 GB of setup each before their first
     counted binding. 5.6 GB at the trip, 6.4 when the process exited.
  3. *The scorer's grounding was unarmed.* `ground_task` is the validator
     entry, unwalled on purpose ("a plan found is a plan"). But since Lane S
     the scorer grounds BEFORE the chase, inside the optional-work scope,
     where the clock already stops it -- and the memory wall looked away while
     it took pipesworld-complex i16 from 0.21 GB to 6.4 with the plan banked.

**Fixed** (`mem.rs`, `ground.rs`, `search.rs`, `temporal.rs`): a checkpoint
every 256 ops inside interning; a trip LATCHES its scope (`mem::latched`,
cleared when the outermost `ScopedDeadline` closes) so the next grounding is
refused at the door and the next search on its first pop; every grounding
entry arms inside bounded work. `tests/mem_wall.rs` pins the latch, RED on
`5a102b8` (the second tier built 29,708 nodes after the trip).

| alone, `FF_MEM_BUDGET_GB=6`, true peak | `5a102b8` | fixed |
|---|---|---|
| elevator-strips i30 | 6.4 GB (a kill), 11 s | **4.50 GB**, 6.7 s, same makespan 1571.1 |
| pipesworld-complex i16 | 6.4 GB (a kill), 24 s | **4.51 GB**, 19.3 s, banked plan, NOT scored |

**Both subsets again, on the fix** (`run-mem-fixed.sh`, `6-`/`7-*.log`,
`memhigh-compare-fixed.txt`):

| | `5a102b8` | fixed |
|---|---|---|
| the 54 `mem-cap` cells, solved | 16 | **23** -- and none of the 16 lost |
| the 58 solved at >= 3.5 GB, solved | 56 | **58 of 58, banked in ONE pass** (four, and one row still owed, before) |
| ... metric identical | 51 | 49 |
| ... metric worse | 1 | 1 (tpp-simple i17, 2409 -> 2411) |
| ... **solved, metric given up** | 4 | **8** |
| ... summed solve time vs the candidate | 0.78x | 0.76x |

The seven more: pipesworld-complex i18, storage-complex i14-i18,
storage-qualitative i19. The eight that keep their row and lose their number
are the price, and it is stated rather than netted off: storage-qualitative
i15/i16 and storage-simple i20 come back unpriced (the compiled preference
task trips while grounding), and pipesworld-complex i12-i16 come back NOT
SCORED -- their scorer grounds the whole snap task, 4.4 GB of it, to replay one
plan. Every one of the eight sat within a gigabyte of the cap on the candidate
by a SAMPLED peak; two cells that looked just like them were the two kills
above.

**Named, and next in line: a scorer at plan size.** Lane T already refuses to
ground a full snap task to validate one plan (`validate_at_plan_size`: the
domain specialised to the plan's own steps); `SoftScorer::prepare` still does
exactly that to SCORE one. Five cells here, and every complex-preference solve
pays it (pathways-complex i20: 12.7 s of scorer grounding). What it needs
before it can be trusted: `verify::eval_formula` reads "fact never grounded"
as false, and at plan size an init-true atom no step touches is never
grounded -- so the fallback to the init has to come first, with a fixture
that scores the same plan both ways.

**The trip line was measured, not argued** (`trip-frac.tsv`, twelve at-risk
cells x {0.75, 0.85}, true peaks). Nothing reads better at 0.85 -- same
metrics, same makespans -- and pipesworld-metric-time i41 peaks at **5.97 of
6** there against 4.88. 0.75 stays. `FF_MEM_TRIP_FRAC` is the knob that
measured it.

**RECORDED NEGATIVE -- pricing the unpriced plan by replay.** When the
compiled preference task does not ground, the hard-goal plan comes back with
`metric: null`. `verify::verify` can price any plan over the ORIGINAL pair, so
the fallback called it (`replay-pricing-NEGATIVE.patch`, built, tested,
removed). Three guards were needed before it told the truth -- a metric with
any non-`is-violated` term, a precondition preference (tpp: a hard-goal plan
violates them per step and the replay would not count it -- the number comes
out too GOOD), a soft trajectory constraint (the replay re-expands every
instance: storage-qualitative i20 went to 6.18 GB) -- and what was left was
two cells. On one of them, storage-simple i20, the replay took the peak from
4.62 GB to **5.91** and still did not fit; at 0.85 it reached 6.01. The prize
was the price of an EMPTY plan. A banked row is not wagered for that.

**What this says about the instrument** (owed to the crucible, not built):
`run.peak_rss` is a sampled maximum, and two published-shape "solves" were
6.6 and 6.4 GB under a 6 GB cap. `wait4` already gives the supervisor
`ru_maxrss` -- the true peak, free -- beside the CPU time it takes from the
same call. Until a row carries it, "solved at 5.9 GB" means "was not looking".

### What the six boards' gain is MADE OF -- and the score SGPlan5 was actually ranked on

With Lane M laid over the candidate (`tally.py --mem --mem-engine
62b4f03a51d3`; an overlay of re-measured cells, so an ESTIMATE until one
engine runs the whole set at the cut):

| | published 0.27.1 | lanes candidate | + Lane M |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| six IPC-5 boards, of 788 | 379 | 546 (+167, 1 lost) | **569 (+190, 0 lost)** |
| variants SGPlan5 ran, of 678 (SGPlan5: 612) | 316 | 468 | **491 -- the gap 296 -> 121** |

Per board, against SGPlan5: simple-pref 130 v 129, qual-pref 98 v 100,
complex-pref 82 v 105, time 76 v 80, metric-time 85 v 151, constraints 20 v 47.

**46 of the +190 are the EMPTY plan** (`composition.py`). Twelve
tpp-qualitative rows, twenty-four pathways-complex, six storage-complex,
four storage-qualitative: problems with no hard goal at all, where
"do nothing" is a valid plan, VAL accepts it, and every preference is
violated. That is the boards' standing convention, not something this cycle
invented -- the published 0.27.1 boards carry 27 of them (pathways-simple i7,
i8, i12-i30) -- but a headline that says +190 without saying **144 real plans
and 46 empty ones** is a headline this roadmap has withdrawn before. Fifteen
solved preference rows carry no metric at all.

And coverage is not what IPC-5 ranked these tracks on. `quality.py`: over the
cells SGPlan5 solved, the IPC score (best metric / ours, 0 for no plan or no
metric; its `; MetricValue` against our banked metric, all minimised):

| | 0.27.1 | now | SGPlan5 | better / equal / worse than SGPlan5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| simple-pref (130) | 94.8 | 94.0 | 119.4 | 29 / 19 / 81 |
| qual-pref (100) | 45.8 | 59.2 | 84.8 | 26 / 3 / 64 |
| complex-pref (105) | 20.1 | 50.6 | 67.9 | 11 / 3 / 59 |

**The lanes closed coverage and left quality where it was.** qual-pref went
from 49 rows behind to 2, and from 39 points behind to 26. simple-pref has
been level on rows since before this cycle and is 25 points behind. Where the
points are: trucks (qual 5.6 of 18.5, simple 8.4 of 19.0), tpp (qual 8.5 of
19.0, complex 2.4 of 8.0), pathways. These are the rows where the optimizer
ends its wall holding exactly what it was handed -- incumbent zero is a FLOOR,
and on these the floor is also the ceiling.

**So "how do we beat SGPlan5" now has two halves with different answers.**
Rows: 121 to find, 66 of them metric-time (numeric guidance -- the consumable
the relaxation cannot see) and 27 constraints (`within`), both untouched this
cycle. Points: the preference optimizer's first improving step on trucks, tpp
and pathways -- a plan-side local search over the banked plan is the obvious
candidate, since SGPlan5's own architecture is exactly that, and nothing here
has priced it yet.

## THE CUT — 0.28.0 (opened 2026-09-21)

The workspace is at 0.28.0, the `cut28` set is in the manifest (the same 32
boards as cut27, stage `benchmarks/air28`, version gate 0.28), and the release
text is written: `CHANGELOG.md` [0.28.0], the README's Status line and "What's
new in 0.28.0", the book's temporal, PDDL3 and tuning chapters.
`scripts/release-notes-roll.py --check` passes.

**What the release text claims, and on what.** Only what the crucible
measured on subsets this cycle: the six IPC-5 boards (379 -> 569, labelled an
overlay and an estimate, with its 144 / 46 real / empty split and the quality
table against SGPlan5), and the two equal-N regression reads. It claims NO
32-board number. The README's standings block is generated
(`benchmarks/standings.py`) and still shows 0.27.0's sweep; the Status line
says so in words until the sweep below is promoted.

**The estimator, declared BEFORE the sweep runs** (the INSTRUMENT section
below withdrew 0.27's +115 for want of exactly this):

1. The COMPARATIVE claim 0.27.0 -> 0.28.0 is **first attempt against first
   attempt**, per cell, over the 8,444 -- `benchmarks/attempts-estimator.py
   --a <0.27.0 engine> --b <0.28.0 engine>`, the `first` row, with its
   bootstrap interval. Both engines were given exactly one first attempt;
   nothing else in the record is equal by construction.
2. `equal-N` is reported beside it. If the two disagree in SIGN, no delta is
   claimed and the release says so.
3. BANKED coverage -- what the boards and the README block show -- is
   published as the boards' standing number and never as a delta.
4. The empty-plan count is published with the preference boards' coverage
   (`probes-0.28/lanes-crucible/composition.py`, pointed at `air28`).

**What is left, in order** (nothing here needs an engine change):

1. `crucible --repo /Users/harold/ferroplan sweep --set cut28 --headless`,
   detached, log to `benchmarks/cut28-sweep.log`. Days, not hours. No cargo
   build or test on the box while it runs.
2. The regression re-check through the crucible: `compare --lost` against
   0.27.0's banked rows, then `sweep --rows` on what it names, before any row
   is called a loss.
3. `bash benchmarks/promote-air28.sh` (refuses a partial sweep; regenerates
   `benchmarks/ipc-standings.md`, `STANDINGS.md` and the README block, and
   demands `crucible standings --check` parity).
4. `python3 scripts/standings-snapshot.py --version 0.28.0 --measured-at <the
   sweep's date>`.
5. The release text gets its 32-board paragraph under the estimator above; the
   README Status line goes back to the standing sentence ("... are on
   crates.io"); the [0.28.0] date becomes the publish date.
   `release-notes-roll.py --check`.
6. Full pre-flight again on the final commit (`RELEASING.md`), push, fast-forward
   `main`, then `./publish.sh` -- the operator's step, not the cycle's.

**Pre-flight on the release candidate, 2026-09-21** (`RELEASING.md`, rustc
1.98.1 = latest stable). It ran twice, because the first run found two things
and one of them was hiding the other.

1. **`opt_wall::opt_ladder_spends_the_wall` was never a load flake.** It
   failed 5 runs in 12 ALONE on an idle box. Its `resume` leg pins the
   sprint-resume machinery, whose trigger is a FAILED LM-cut probe, and it
   starved the probe with a slice of the WALL: 0.001 of 30 s. On a quiet M5
   LM-cut certifies that fixture in 103 evaluations and about 30 ms, so the
   probe SUCCEEDED half the time (child, 25 runs a setting: handover 14/25 at
   0.001; 25/25 at 0.0003, 0.0001, 0.00003). It had been filed as a load flake
   because a loaded box is a slower one -- the condition under which it
   passes. Re-derived to 0.0001; 20 of 20. The file had already learned this
   once, for the sprint slice, from the other side.
2. **Behind it: the compression rung and the actor scheduler.** `cargo test`
   without `--no-fail-fast` stops at the first failing BINARY, so
   `opt_wall` had been hiding every ignored test after it in the alphabet, in
   every run of this pass all cycle. One of them,
   `escalation_ladder_rescues_predicate_build`, read makespan **47.0** for its
   documented 109. The plan is valid: `examples/cabin/crew.pddl` is LOCKLESS by
   design ("one job per worker" is `tsched`'s convention, not a
   precondition), and Lane T's left-shift overlaps what the PDDL allows -- one
   worker, four jobs at once. Legal, VAL-valid, and under `FF_TCONC=1` not what
   was asked for: the rung answered before the actor scheduler was reached.
   **Fixed:** `tcompress::declines` stands aside when `FF_TCONC` is set, and
   the cabin crews read 109 / 63 / 47 under the README's flags on 0.27.1 and
   0.28.0 alike. Without the flag the default route's answer on a lockless
   domain HAS changed (109 / 152 / 198 -> 47 / 47 / 47), and the changelog, the
   book and the example say so under "Changed". The test now pins both
   mechanisms -- the ladder's rescue with the rung hatched off (a child
   process), and "the smaller makespan wins" on the default route -- and
   `tests/tcompress.rs` pins the decline. No board sets `FF_TCONC`; nothing
   measured this cycle moves.

3. **An empty file, tracked by accident, blocked the checkout the sweep runs
   from.** `3e9e013` had committed a 0-byte `benchmarks/cut27-sweep.1.log`
   beside a `sweep.rs` change; in the operator's checkout the REAL log of that
   sweep (201 KB) sits untracked at the same path, so `git checkout main`
   refused. Untracked again (`43e502f`), and the cut stages and sweep logs are
   ignored the way every earlier cycle's are. The real log was never moved.
4. **`golden_standings` is red in the checkout that has the raws, and should
   be, until the promote.** It renders `STANDINGS.md` from the repo and
   compares bytes; the movement column's predecessor is the newest snapshot
   strictly below the WORKSPACE version, so from the bump to 0.28.0 until
   `promote-air28.sh` regenerates the tables it reads `= (vs 0.27.0)` against
   the committed `+1.1 pts (vs 0.26.0)`. Regenerating now would publish a table
   of equals signs. In the worktree, where the raws are absent, the test skips
   and `crucible/preflight.sh` is **clean** end to end (it needed the
   operator's checkout to carry `cut28` first: `tui --dump` reads that
   manifest, not the worktree's).

**The sweep is running.** Launched 2026-09-21 ~10:50 from the operator's
checkout (`/Users/harold/ferroplan`, `main` = `43e502f`), detached:
`crucible --repo /Users/harold/ferroplan sweep --set cut28 --headless`, log
`benchmarks/cut28-sweep.log`, stage `benchmarks/air28/`. Engine
**`ff 0.28.0 [89cfdc5f06ed]`**, 8,444 instances, 32 boards. Until it says
SWEEP COMPLETE: no cargo build or test on the box, and NOTHING rebuilds
`/Users/harold/ferroplan/target/release/ff` -- a rebuilt binary is a different
engine to the database, and the sweep would be measuring two.

**And then it hung.** Three hours after launch the operator looked for `ff`
and found none. The sweep was alive at 0 % CPU; the log had nothing in it but
width changes. `sample` showed the main thread in `run_batch`, blocked on the
batch's channel, and ONE worker left, asleep a second at a time:

```rust
if w > 0 && w >= ctx.shared.width() { sleep(1 s); continue; }   // asked FIRST
let Some(..) = queue.pop_front() else { break };                 // never reached
```

The first batch packed 10 wide; foreign load (`mobileassetd`, `deleted`, an
operator at the keyboard) held the policy width at 9 or under all day. Nine
workers banked 77 cells in fifteen seconds and left; worker 9 never passed
the width gate, so never saw the empty queue, so never dropped its sender --
and a channel drains until every sender is gone. In the tree since `67a5ded`
(09-05); cut27 survived it only because its width touched 10 somewhere in
every batch, and this cycle's subsets never packed wide (`--engine` has no
predecessor, so every cell classes solo). **Fixed:** `worker_gate` asks the
queue first -- an empty queue ends a worker whatever the width says. Two
fixtures, both RED under the old order: the rule, and the shape (ten workers,
the policy pinned at nine, a five-item queue, a collector that must finish
inside ten seconds). SIGINT ended the hung run cleanly -- 77 banked, 8,367
owed, nothing lost -- and the sweep was restarted on the same engine
(`89cfdc5f06ed`: only the crucible was rebuilt, never `ff`). **Owed to the
crucible:** a sweep that has spawned nothing for N minutes while it owes rows
and is not SUSPENDED should say so in the log. This one was found by a person
looking at a process list.

**The lesson for the gate itself:** `publish.sh` and `RELEASING.md` run the
ignored pass fail-fast. One red binary early in the alphabet turns the rest
of the gate off without saying so. Both now say `--no-fail-fast`.

## THE INSTRUMENT — a published row is best-of-N, and N was not controlled

Found while trying to reproduce ONE row. It outranks every lane below it,
because every lane below it is scored on this instrument.

**The reproduction failure.** `ipc5-metric-time`'s
`pipesworld-metric-time` i7/i8/i9 are published SOLVED (29.46 s len 9,
29.03 s len 11, 42.69 s len 36, `val: true` — VAL checked the plans). On
today's box, at the board's own 60 s wall, through the board's own
harness (`ipc67.py --track metric-time-2006`), they do not solve under
FIVE arms: engine-0.28 1-wide, engine-0.28 2-wide, v0.27.1 1-wide,
v0.26.0 1-wide, and by hand. v0.26.0 is the binary that solved all three
on 2026-09-11. Not the engine, not the width, not the corpus (pinned
2017 checkout, untouched since July), not `FF_MEM_BUDGET_GB`.

**The cause, from `~/.crucible/db/crucible.db`.** The crucible re-ran
them until they solved, and the board kept the attempt that did:

```
i7 @ 0.27.0   attempt 1 unsolved, 2 unsolved, 3 SOLVED   -> banked
i8 @ 0.27.0   attempt 1 unsolved, 2 unsolved, 3 SOLVED   -> banked
i9 @ 0.27.0   attempts 1-4 unsolved, attempt 5 SOLVED    -> banked (dirty)
```

My single-shot runs reproduce attempts 1–4 faithfully. Nothing is wrong
with them.

**The scale.** Across the record — keyed by BUILD, not by version string,
because three distinct 0.26.0 builds sit in this db and keying on `ver`
splices their attempts into one sequence — **543 cells are solved only
because a retry rescued them**, and 324 of those winning attempts are
`timing_quality: dirty`. Where one build both solved and failed the same
instance (590 cells), the record banks the solve **590 times out of 590**.
N per cell runs 1–18.

**Why the retries are one-directional.** A re-run is triggered by failure
and never by success, so extra attempts can only ADD solves:

```
                   attempt 1 SOLVED        attempt 1 FAILED       rescued
v0.26.0       4845 cells, re-run  0.0%   3599 cells, re-run 27.0%    162
ff 0.27.0     4827 cells, re-run  0.0%   3617 cells, re-run 68.7%    295
```

The retry rule is sound and exists for a measured reason (cut27's false
timeouts under swap thrash; the SUSPECT rule). Two things about it are
not: a SOLVE under the same thrash is never re-tested (0.0 %, both
engines), and the two engines' failures were re-rolled at rates that
differ by 2.5×.

**What it does to this cycle's headline.** `benchmarks/attempts-estimator.py`,
over the 8,444 instances both builds ran (receipt:
`benchmarks/metrics/attempts-estimator-cut27.txt`):

| estimator | v0.26.0 | ff 0.27.0 | delta | 95 % CI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| banked — what the boards publish | 5007 | 5122 | **+115** | [+93, +139] |
| solved on ANY attempt | 5007 | 5122 | +115 | [+93, +139] |
| FIRST attempt only | 4845 | 4827 | −18 | [−54, +22] |
| **equal-N** (max over first min(N_A,N_B)) | 4931 | 4890 | **−41** | [−80, +1] |
| per-run (expected coverage of ONE run) | 4918.6 | 4949.5 | +31 | [+4, +59] |

And the delta decomposes exactly:

```
first-attempt -18  +  rescue difference (295 - 162) +133  =  +115
```

**The whole of +115 is the difference in how many failures each engine was
allowed to retry.** On the one instrument both engines were given equally
— their first attempt — 0.27.0 is 18 rows BEHIND, inside the noise.

**This is not a claim that 0.27 regressed**, and the per-board table says
why. Under equal-N the 2011/2014 families hold their gains
(`ipc2014-sat` +17, `ipc2014-mco-t4` +15, `ipc7-mco-t2` +9,
`ipc67-results` +9) while others reverse hard (`ipc5-prop` +5 → −43,
`ipc67-temporal` −1 → −25, `ipc2018-sat` +4 → −22). Some of the engine
work is real. The AGGREGATE is what the instrument cannot support.

**A trap for whoever reads this next.** `timing_quality` is not a
severity: clean runs solve LESS often than dirty ones (v0.26.0 28.2 % vs
64.1 %), because clean re-runs were targeted at the hard owed rows.
`clean-only` is therefore a biased subset, not a cleaner measurement, and
the `+76` it reports is worth nothing.

**Owed, and it blocks the lanes.** (1) Adopt one estimator, declared in
advance — equal-N or per-run, not banked — and re-read cut27 under it;
the db has every attempt, so this is re-analysis, not box time. (2) Re-test
a sample of BANKED SOLVES, which nothing in the loop currently does, to
price the ratchet's other half. (3) Publish attempts and timing_quality
beside coverage, so a row says how many tries it took. (4) Only then
re-read anything resting on the delta, this cycle's SGPlan arithmetic
included.

**Deliberately NOT changed here.** `README.md` ("61 % coverage
(5,122/8,444) … +134 over 0.26.0") and `CHANGELOG.md` state the banked
coverage of a SHIPPED release. The coverage figure is what the boards
record and stays true as that; the COMPARATIVE claims (+134, +115) are the
ones this section withdraws, and rewriting a published release's notes is
the operator's call, not a correction to make quietly inside a cycle doc.
`benchmarks/cut27-compare-0.26-vs-0.27.txt` is left exactly as the tool
wrote it, for the same reason a receipt is not edited.

## Lane W (candidate, NOT scoped) — declaring a wall can make the engine worse

Found while chasing the withdrawn slicing lever, and kept because it
reproduces in under a second on the CLASSICAL path, where the rung ladder
actually runs. `blocks(30)` — the `tests/call_budget.rs` fixture, 30
blocks in a single tower, `--threads 1`, release:

| declared wall | solved | spent |
|---|---|---:|
| *none* | yes | 0.19 s |
| 0.12 s | **no** | 0.13 s |
| 0.20 s | **no** | 0.25 s |
| 0.50 s | **no** | 0.59 s |
| 1.00 s | yes | 0.18 s |

A 0.5 s wall is 2.6× the unbudgeted solve time and still fails: telling
the engine it has half a second is strictly worse than telling it
nothing. `FF_WALL_DEBUG` names the mechanism outright —

```
wall: EHC slice exhausted (3678 evals in 0.12s), handing down the ladder
wall: novelty-light slice exhausted (4096 pops in 0.05s)
wall: LAMA slice extended to 0.13s ... extended to 0.37s (recency)
wall: novelty skipped (remaining Some(0.0) unaffordable at rung entry)
wall: best-first checkpoint expired at 1 evals (capped return)
```

— against `wall: solved by EHC` at 1.0 s and unbudgeted. EHC needs ~0.19 s
and `FF_EHC_WALL_FRAC` (0.25) hands it 0.12 s.

**The existing hatch is the zero-code arm.** `FF_NO_EHC_WALLCAP=1` converts
every failing wall above AND finishes INSIDE it (0.11 / 0.16 / 0.18 s) —
it is not trading the wall away. `FF_NO_RUNG_WALLCAP=1` also "solves" but
overruns 3× (0.88–1.39 s), so it is not a candidate policy, only the
permanent RED record it already is.

**Why this is not a free +N, and why the lane is unscoped.** The
discrimination is the whole problem, and this repo has already lost one
round of it. `ladder_wall.rs`'s `capped` leg exists because on the
`laddertax` shape EHC-direct eats ~2× the wall and the SLICE is what
converts the row; blocks(30) is the opposite shape at the same rung.
LAMA got a progress-conditional extension for exactly this reason (0.22
Phase 5A a1: hiking-2014 i6's 43 s of steady progress vs tetris i4's 400k
evals of none), and the 0.24 attempt to sharpen recency into ARRIVAL died
because nurikabe and spider's constants CROSS. EHC never got either
treatment. Its own progress signal ("no improving state") is
arrival-shaped by construction, which is a reason to think it separates
where LAMA's did not — and no reason at all to claim it does.

Owed before any claim: the two fixtures side by side (blocks(30) green,
`laddertax` still green), then a board A/B. Constituency on the boards is
UNMEASURED; nothing here licenses a number.

## Anti-pots — priced at zero, standing

Everything 0.27 listed carries forward. Added this cycle:

- **A preferences/ESPC wing without the parity probe.** The mechanism is
  already in the tree (`partition.rs`, `espc.rs`, `resolve.rs`), already
  default-on, and already beating SGPlan5 on quality. What is missing is a
  price, and one 1800 s probe is the whole cost of getting it.
- **Any Lane A claim from a board diff.** The 0.27 staged diff reads −22
  on `ipc5-prop` and −11 on `ipc5-time` on boards that still owe rows;
  board diffs on unfinished boards are noise. Named instances, same box,
  old binary, or nothing.
- **Widening the packed scheduler on the strength of 0.27's gains.** The
  gains are the engine (see the table above). The packing calibration's
  own numbers — 4-wide +72.8 % median wall inflation — stand.
