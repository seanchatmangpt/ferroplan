# ferroplan 0.28 roadmap — the rung 0.27 skipped

Scoped 2026-09-06, while the 0.27 cut sweep was still running. **This cycle
does not merge to `main` until 0.27.0 is published**: the cut is measuring
`ff 0.27.0 [86302e06d81b]`, and an engine change on `main` would re-identify
the binary the sweep is halfway through. All 0.28 work lives on
`engine-0.28` in its own worktree (`/Users/harold/ferroplan-0.28`, its own
`target/`) so a build here cannot touch the binary the sweep spawns.

The headline is not a new mechanism. It is a lever this project already
built, already measured, and wired into three of its four search rungs.

---

## The finding this cycle is built on

0.27 added the anchored successor generator (`PackedTask::applicable_ops`,
`packed.rs`): expansion walks the state's true facts through an index
instead of testing every grounded operator. It was wired into the
classical rung (`search.rs:1038`), the LAMA rung (`lama.rs:343`) and the
novelty rungs (`novelty.rs:317/467/784`).

It was **not** wired into the temporal rung. `temporal.rs:3291` is still

    (0..task.n_ops).filter(|&oi| allow(oi)).collect()

and `grep -c applicable_ops crates/ferroplan/src/temporal.rs` returns 0.

That omission ran a controlled experiment nobody designed. Between
`benchmarks/air26/` and `benchmarks/air27/` there is exactly one engine
commit (`git log 677eafc..HEAD -- crates/ferroplan/src` → `69cb96a`), and
on the boards the 0.27 sweep has finished:

| board | 0.26 | 0.27 | delta | rung wired |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| ipc2014-sat | 161 | 173 | **+12** | yes |
| ipc2014-agile | 158 | 172 | **+14** | yes (board still owed rows) |
| ipc67-netben | 268 | 270 | +2 | yes |
| ipc2026-opt | 22 | 23 | +1 | yes |
| **ipc2014-tempo** | **78** | **78** | **±0** | **no** |

Two things follow, and the second one matters as much as the first.

1. **The lever has an in-house price.** The identical change bought +12 and
   +14 where it was wired. Its temporal constituency is real: 83 of the
   122 unsolved rows on `ipc2014-tempo` carry the note "temporal ladder
   stopped at the wall" — storage-t 18/20, floor-tile-t 18/19, rtam 14/16,
   driver-log 10/19.
2. **It rules out the instrument as the explanation for 0.27's gains.**
   The packed scheduler applied to every board equally. If the movement
   were width, `ipc2014-tempo` would have moved too. It did not.

---

## Phase 0 — the entry gate (blocking, no cycle work until it closes)

1. **cut27 reaches a terminal state.** Five of thirty-two boards are
   `.done`; no 0.28 row claim is refereeable against a partial baseline.
2. **The two-binary differential.** Same box, solo, alternating, three
   reps, a canary reading between pairs: `ff 0.26.0 [03a17198744b]` against
   `ff 0.27.0 [86302e06d81b]` over every instance 0.26 solved that 0.27
   did not. Pre-registered fork, written before the numbers land:
   - both fail now → the box changed, not the engine;
   - 0.26 solves and 0.27 fails → `69cb96a`'s byte-identity claim is false
     in the field, **Lane A does not open**, and the cycle's first job is
     that defect;
   - both solve → conditions, and every packed 0.27 row is suspect.
   The differential doubles as Lane A's referee, so it is run once and
   used twice.
3. **Real width on the row.** Every raw still stamps the manifest's
   `jobs = 2` whether it was measured 2-wide (air25), 1-wide (air26) or
   10-wide (air27). Until the measured concurrency is on the row, no
   reader can separate a +N from packing noise. Known prerequisite: the
   runner passes the NOMINAL batch width, fixed outside the worker scope,
   while the width policy collapses the real one constantly.
4. **The cut27 postmortem**, as Phase 4 of the 0.27 roadmap pre-registered
   it: passes, wall-clock hours, and the box's condition, whatever they say.

### Phase 0 — status, 2026-09-16

1. **CLOSED.** All 32 cut27 boards are `.done`; 0.27.0 was promoted and
   published 2026-09-10 (5,122/8,444).
2. **Run 2026-09-16, same box, both binaries alternating, 3 reps.** The
   lost set, read from the crucible database: 22 instances where 0.26.0
   [03a17198744b] banked a solve in the cut26 sweep and 0.27.0
   [86302e06d81b] banked a miss in cut27. Neither original binary survives
   (`target/` was rebuilt), so the pair is `v0.26.0` rebuilt [8fe896b4fd53]
   against `v0.27.0` rebuilt. 16 of the 22 were solved by 0.26 at ≥ 58 s
   of a 60 s wall. Results are recorded below the postmortem.

   **CLOSED 2026-09-16: the fork reads "not the engine".** Each cell
   counts solves out of 3 repeats. The canary read 0.49–1.14 s (median
   0.55) across 66 readings. The box was shared with the v0.26.0 backfill.
   In repeat 1, three tetris-mco runs peaked near 8 GB each and pushed it
   into swap; that is the repeat where everything failed.

   | outcome | instances | 0.26 | 0.27 |
   |---|---|---:|---:|
   | both solve | tetris-mco t2 i16, t4 i15, t4 i16, t8 i16; hydropower-opt i14; elevator-t i10; elevator-t-strips i28; pathways-complex i11 | 18/24 | 18/24 |
   | 0.27 solves, 0.26 does not | parking-agile i10; parking-mco-t8 i1, i9, i17; recharging-robots i14 | 1/15 | 12/15 |
   | both fail | spider i17; folding-agile-300s i2; recharging-robots i4; storage-qual i12, i18; scanalyzer i18, strips i28; parking-mco-t4 i19 | 0/24 | 0/24 |
   | 0.26 once, 0.27 never | scanalyzer-strips i29 | 1/3 | 0/3 |

   Not one instance fits "0.26 solves and 0.27 fails". The single 0.26-only
   solve is 1 of 3 at the wall. `69cb96a`'s byte-identity claim holds in the
   field, and the 22 cut27 misses are conditions (8 failures shared by
   both binaries, 8 instances that both solve on a quieter box) plus five
   rows where 0.27 is the stronger binary. The Lane A arm is moot, since
   that lane is already a recorded negative.
3. **BUILT** (`crucible-r2` fd4ea3f). A row's `neighbours` is now the PEAK
   number of planners that ran beside it over its lifetime, not
   `width − 1` fixed before the workers started. It goes to the
   database, where the referee reads it, and onto the raw row as
   `neighbours`. The resume identity keeps `jobs`, so no banked row is
   re-owed. The running resident still uses the old binary until it is
   restarted.
4. **The cut27 postmortem.** The pre-registration was one pass plus its
   solo tail, within 36 h. **It took 141 h of wall-clock** (2026-09-04
   22:20 → 09-10 19:28) across nine sweep sessions; the last one finished
   in 2 passes. 12,800 runs banked 8,444 rows, and 2,486 instances took
   more than one run (at most 18). Of the 134.6 planner-hours, **63.4
   (47 %) went to runs that were not banked**:

   | verdict (not banked) | runs | planner-h |
   |---|---:|---:|
   | demoted (the E-core defect, fixed 09-07) | 1,996 | 33.1 |
   | thermal | 878 | 13.9 |
   | starved | 682 | 4.2 |
   | packed | 259 | 4.3 |
   | contended | 307 | 4.2 |
   | suspect / recheck / swap / uncovered | 234 | 3.8 |

   The box's condition: in ordinary use throughout. Worst incident: the
   09-07 disk cleanup deleted `target/` and the sweep sat dead for 11 h.
   The E-core demotion alone cost more than the whole 36 h budget. Mean
   nominal neighbours on the record: 2.4, max 9. That number is the old
   stamp, which is what item 3 fixes.

## Lane A (headline) — the temporal successor rung

**Measure first.** A per-expansion split (candidate scan / h / apply) on
driver-log-t i5 (61,092 ops, 1.0–1.1k evals/s), rtam i16 (13,176 ops,
~4.5k/s), satellite i5 (17,676 ops, 5.5k/s) and storage-time i15 (3,744
ops), on a quiet box.

**Pre-registered kill:** if the candidate scan is under ~10 % of the
per-evaluation wall on all four, the lever is a **recorded negative that
day** and Lane A ends there. Nobody has read the scan's share of a
*temporal* evaluation; `temporal-attribution-0.23.md` measured a different
term (h-build per eval), and 0.27 already recorded that one as a negative.

**Band, labelled as interpolation:** +2 to +8 on `ipc2014-tempo`,
concentrated on storage-t and rtam. NOT the +10–30 the 0.27 speed lane
pre-registered for itself.

**Carve-out:** the orbit/symmetry block records a generator class before
the applicability test, so the substitution is not byte-identical under
`FF_ORBIT_GEN=1` — that arm keeps the full scan, and it is already a
recorded negative ("match-cellar lost 9 instances to it").

### Lane A — RECORDED NEGATIVE, 2026-09-11. The lane ends here.

The pre-registered kill fired. Candidate-scan SELF time, sampled on a box
with one competing core (Steam), `FF_NO_TSUCC=1` so the full scan is the
thing being measured, `sample` at ~1 kHz:

| instance | ops | scan share | heuristic share |
|---|---|---|---|
| driver-log-t i5 | 61,092 | **0.01 %** | 99.6 % |
| rtam i16 | 13,176 | **7.70 %** | ~97 % |
| satellite i5 | 17,676 | **0.09 %** | 98.7 % |
| storage-t i15 | 3,744 | **0.72 %** | 96.9 % |

Under ~10 % on all four, which is the condition this lane wrote down in
advance for ending itself. The 7.70 % on rtam is the loose end and it is
loose in the safe direction: that sample carries more than one thread, so
its denominator is understated and the true share is lower.

**Why it is not close.** 61,092 ops was chosen as the case where an
O(n_ops) scan should hurt most, and it is the instance where the scan is
LEAST visible — 0.01 %. Every sample that is not the scan is the relaxed
planning graph: `push_node → eval_node → relaxed_helpful →
relaxed_to_inner → build_rpg`, 16,384 of 16,441 samples on driver-log-t.
The scan does not even appear as a frame; it inlines into
`temporal_search` and shows only as self time.

**What this confirms rather than discovers.** 0.27 recorded the same shape
for the classical path: "what is left on these boards is the relaxation
floor itself, ~1.7-2 ms per evaluation at 60-80k ops, proportional to the
effects the fired ops carry. Moving it means firing fewer ops (relevance)
or evaluating fewer states, not a faster scan." Nobody had read that
share for a TEMPORAL evaluation, which is why the measurement was worth
its afternoon. It reads the same.

**The code stays.** `98a74e1` wires the anchored generator into the
temporal rung and is byte-identical by construction (candidates sorted
back into the scan's order), so it is neither a win nor a risk: it
removes a 0.01-7.7 % term and costs nothing. `FF_NO_TSUCC=1` keeps the
full scan for exactly this kind of measurement. What is withdrawn is the
CLAIM -- the +2 to +8 band on `ipc2014-tempo` is not pursued and no
differential is run for it, because a term that small cannot pay for one.

**Cost of the lane:** one afternoon, four samples, no sweep.

## Lane A' (the replacement headline) — the node cap is a model, and the model may be wrong

Lane A died on its own kill criterion the same afternoon it was measured,
so this takes the headline. It comes from the 0.27 cut rather than from a
guess.

**The observation.** 937 rows across the seven optimality boards banked
UNSOLVED with the note `inconclusive: node cap reached after N
expansions`. They did not run out of time; they ran out of node budget.
And they did it while barely touching the 6 GB the boards declare:

| board | capped rows | avg GB actually used |
|---|---|---|
| ipc-opt-2008-11 | 253 | 1.74 |
| ipc2023-numeric-opt | 179 | 3.36 |
| ipc2014-opt | 174 | 1.38 |
| ipc2018-opt | 117 | **0.93** |
| ipc2026-opt-full | 96 | 4.38 |
| ipc2023-opt | 81 | **0.80** |
| ipc2026-opt | 37 | 4.00 |

`ipc2018-opt` stops having used 15 % of its declared budget. The cap is
derived from `node_bytes_target` over a MODEL of per-insertion cost --
deliberately, because the count has to be serial and thread-count
independent, so it can never be RSS. That design is right. The question
nobody has asked is whether the model's bytes-per-node is ACCURATE, and
four boards stopping under 2 GB of a 6 GB budget is what makes it worth
asking.

**The receipt.** `openstacks-sequential-optimal-strips/16`, traced at the
0.27 cut: 0.26 proved it in 53.29 s using 3.82 GB and 4,250,212
expansions; 0.27 capped at 3,798,074 expansions with 3.05 GB -- 89 % of
the way to a proof it had the memory to finish. The cut-time re-check
proved it again on a quiet box. One row, but it is the mechanism in
miniature: the cap, not the clock, and not the engine.

**Measure first.** Modelled bytes-per-node against measured, on the four
boards with the widest gap (2018-opt, 2023-opt, 2014-opt,
opt-2008-11). The measurement is RSS growth over nodes inserted across a
run, compared with what `per_node_model_bytes` predicted for the same
task. No engine change to take the measurement.

**Pre-registered kill:** if the model is within 25 % of measured
bytes-per-node on all four, the caps are honest memory exhaustion, this
lane is a **recorded negative that day**, and the proof tracks' ceiling is
real rather than self-inflicted. Raising a cap that is already accurate
would buy swap, not proofs -- and the referee already owes 50 rows of
this sweep to swap.

**Band, labelled as interpolation:** +15 to +60 across the seven proof
boards, concentrated where the gap is widest. NOT the 937 -- most of
those instances are genuinely too large, and the openstacks receipt was
at 89 % precisely because it was close. Rows recovered here are
certified optima, which is why a smaller band than Lane A's is worth
more: on a proof track, coverage IS proof rate.

**Why it is the right headline for this cycle.** The optimality boards
are the weakest coverage in the table (20-38 %). Every other lane this
cycle aims at boards already above 60 %. And the 0.27 engine work has
now twice been told the same thing by measurement -- the relaxation floor
is the term, not the scan -- so a cycle that keeps pushing per-evaluation
speed is a cycle arguing with its own instrument.

### Lane A' — RECORDED NEGATIVE, 2026-09-16. The premise was a mislabel.

Nothing was measured against the cap, because the cap was not what stopped
these rows. `api.rs` built its node-cap note from `inconclusive()`, the same
constructor the clock trip uses, and never read `clock_tripped`, so **every
optimal row the 60 s wall stopped was banked as "node cap reached"**. The
air27 times had already said so. On the four target boards, 545 of the 625
"capped" rows ran ≥ 57 s and none ran under 50 s; across all seven boards
14 of 937 ran under 50 s, and none under 40 s. The early exits are the
teardown reserve (stored bytes / 4e8 s), not the cap.

**The probe.** 26 of the 937 rows (4 per board, evenly spaced; 2 more
could not be located), re-run with the fixed note (`engine-0.28` 5c94647),
`FF_WALL_DEBUG` for the cap and its per-node model, and
`/usr/bin/time -l` for the peak footprint, with the box shared with the
backfill:

- **26 of 26 stopped at the wall. 0 hit the cap. 0 raised it.**
- Headroom was large everywhere: agricola-opt i1 expanded 234 k nodes
  against a 13.8 M cap (250 MB); barman-2014-opt i1 5.0 M against 18.6 M
  (2.0 GB).
- Where memory was heavy, nothing suggests the model over-charges.
  fo-farmland i19's whole process peaked at 4.89 GB before reaching its
  cap, which is MORE than the 3.87 GB the model charges for a full cap
  (9.76 M × 396 B). factory-robot i14 peaked at 3.96 GB against 3.87 GB
  modelled. The footprint includes the task tables and the open list, so
  this is not a per-node measurement, but the direction is clear. A higher
  cap on the numeric boards would buy swap, not proofs.

The openstacks-16 receipt reads the same way: 0.27 was 89 % through a
proof at the wall, not at the cap. **The ceiling on the proof tracks is the
clock**, so a proof-track lever has to be a cheaper expansion or a better
bound, not a larger cap.

**What stays:** the note fix (5c94647). From the next sweep on, a wall stop
reads `inconclusive: wall reached after N expansions`. The 937 air27 rows
keep their old text, so read them as wall stops.

## Lane B — two cheap claims at the existing 60 s wall

- **The tpp complex-preferences parse.** All 20 rows of
  `tpp-preferences-complex` die `engine-exit-1` at ~0.26 s — the spawn
  floor — in both air25-entries and air26. The domain writes a legal PDDL3
  `preference` inside a durative `:condition`; the parser refuses any
  conjunct head that is not `at`/`over`. Band +3 to +6, sized from this
  engine's own twin (`tpp-metric-time` solves i1–i8 of 40 at the same
  budget on the byte-identical hard goal). **Guaranteed regardless of
  band:** 20 rows leave `engine-reject/error` for a real verdict class —
  the shape the 0.26 mem-cap fix already shipped once. **Open question the
  build must answer first:** if the preference is parsed and then dropped
  downstream, the plans are legal but the METRIC is wrong, which is worse
  than failing loudly. A number the record cannot defend is worse than a
  missing number.
  **BUILT 2026-09-16** (`engine-0.28` 9aabf88). The parser takes
  `(preference name (at start phi))` inside a durative `:condition`, and the
  search drops it. The open question is answered in code: `score_soft`
  binds each durative step's condition preferences and counts one
  violated instance per application (at start before the start happening,
  at end before the end, over all across every state inside the
  interval). The fixtures pin all three timespecs and the forced metric.
  **The board, 20 instances at 60 s, one pass, box shared with the
  backfill: 8 of 20 solve** (i1–i4 in 16–36 s; i5–i8 in 58.6–59.1 s, which
  is on the wall and will not all survive a sweep). The other 12 stop at
  the wall, and none dies engine-exit any more. Honest band: **+4 solid, up
  to +8**, against the +3 to +6 the lane was sized at. No solved plan
  violates p-drive, so the new count reads 0 on every banked row. The
  fixtures, not the board, are what prove the count.
- **The barman optimal gate, no-code arm first.** The 300 s probe proves
  cost 49 at 6,949,349 expansions in 50.4 s of user time; the 60 s board
  rows node-cap at 6.4M expansions in 57 s — short of a certificate the
  same engine completes. Every knob is already an env var. Measure both
  arms solo, then **measure the loss side nobody has measured**: sweep the
  four optimal boards at the changed margin and count the rows lost where
  the gate currently fires inside the old band. Ships only as a changed
  default with an `FF_NO_*` restore. Band +1 to +3, **and a net negative
  is possible.**

## Lane C — two probes, both expected negative

- **Floor-tile's dead-end test.** Specified with a verbatim numeric exit
  clause since 0.26 and never run; `grep FF_DEADEND crates/` returns
  nothing after three cycles. Re-anchor its counters (0.27 moved them) and
  re-take the row set against the 0.27 binary before a line is written.
- **A classical `best_h` trace.** There is no h-descent trace on the
  classical path at all — the 138-row AIBR constituency named in the
  0.26 dossier has never been measured for flat h. One print site fixes
  that, and it is what makes the next cycle's numeric-h question askable.

## Lane D — the per-call budget (unscoped, consumer-driven; SHIPPED IN 0.27.1)

Not on the cycle plan. A consumer embedding ferroplan as a library filed a
concrete ask with a measurement attached, and the measurement is why it
jumped the queue: `solve` was blocking and uninterruptible, so a host that
abandoned the work leaked that thread for the life of the process. Their
own instrumentation recorded 213 solves completed, then 2 abandoned, after
which the pool was dead — 0 completed, 4 abandoned.

Neither existing budget could bound one call. `max_evaluated` caps
evaluated STATES and grounding runs before the first state exists;
`FF_TIME_LIMIT` is armed once per PROCESS from the first solve, so in a
long-lived host it either bounds nothing or eventually refuses
everything.

**Shipped as 0.27.1, not here.** Two fields on `Options`, both `None` by
default and inert unless set: `wall_ms` (armed at the top of `solve`, so
it bounds parsing and grounding too) and `should_continue` (an
`Arc<AtomicBool>` polled wherever the wall is). A stop returns
`solved: false` with a note naming which budget bound and where, never
the word "unsolvable".

It went out as a patch release on the 0.27 line rather than waiting for
this cycle **because it is additive API with no engine change** — so it
needed no sweep, and holding it would have kept a blocked consumer
waiting on Lane A's measurement for no reason. The two commits were
cherry-picked; the rest of this branch stayed behind until it has been
measured. That is the precedent worth keeping: API that cannot move a
number does not need a cut behind it.

Held per call in a thread-local armed by an RAII guard, so concurrent
solves carry their own and a spent budget cannot leak into the next call
on its thread. `FF_NO_RUNG_WALLCAP` does not disable it — that hatch
governs the env wall, and a budget passed in code outranks an environment
variable.

**Recorded, not acted on:** the rung ladder rations a wall across its
rungs, so a budget is not "time until I stop". A 30-block instance
solving in 34 ms unbudgeted is stopped by a 120 ms wall and solved under a
200 ms one — and `FF_TIME_LIMIT=0.12` fails the same instance while `0.2`
solves it, so this is the env wall's behaviour too, not the new path's.
Teaching the ladder to skip its slicing under small budgets would be a
behaviour change with no measurement behind it.

### Lane C — the classical `best_h` trace, BUILT 2026-09-16

`FF_HTRACE=1` prints `htrace: best_h H at N evaluated (T s)` on stderr each
time the classical weighted-best-first search improves its best h. That is
the site `advance` already records; the trace adds the evaluation count and
the clock. Off by default and silent. The trace has not been read on the
AIBR constituency yet; that read is the probe.

## The SGPlan question, recorded rather than scoped

The operator's standing goal is to beat SGPlan5, and the record's ledger
is the place that fight is scored: metric-time 64/200 vs 151/200,
complex-pref 26/108 vs 105/108, qualitative 46/100 vs 100/100,
propositional 188/220 like-for-like vs 218/220, constraints 20/80 vs
47/80 — against `time`, which this engine now **leads** (88/130 vs 80/130).

Two facts change how that gap should be read, and both are already
measured:

- **On the instances both solve, ferroplan wins on quality**, often by a
  wide margin (qualitative rovers: 68 vs 88, 26.1 vs 43.4, 37.6 vs 88,
  556 vs 674 — lower is better), and the ESPC penalty loop is why
  (`FF_NO_ESPC=1` degrades the same instances to 23/24/29/39/66/65/126/370
  against 19/23/17/16/21/22/66/87). The gap is **coverage**, not quality
  and not a missing mechanism.
- **SGPlan5's numbers were measured at IPC-5's 30-minute limit**; ours are
  at 60 seconds. The published gap therefore overstates the deficit by an
  unknown amount.

**Owed before any SGPlan claim, and cheap: one parity probe.** Run the
qualitative and complex boards at 1800 s, once, as a MEASUREMENT and not a
tier — it answers whether the fight is 54 rows or 5. The standing anti-pot
against new tiers is about *published* tiers; this buys no board and
changes no table. Until that number exists, an SGPlan wing is unpriced,
and this project has three cycles of evidence that bands taken from other
planners' published results deliver +1.

## Anti-pots — priced at zero, standing

Everything 0.27 listed carries forward. Added this cycle:

- **A preferences/ESPC wing without the parity probe.** The mechanism is
  already in the tree (`partition.rs`, `espc.rs`, `resolve.rs`), already
  default-on, and already beating SGPlan5 on quality. What is missing is a
  price, and one 1800 s probe is the whole cost of getting it.
- **Any Lane A claim from a board diff.** The 0.27 staged diff reads −22
  on `ipc5-prop` and −11 on `ipc5-time` on boards that still owe rows;
  board diffs on unfinished boards are noise. Named instances, same box,
  old binary, or nothing.
