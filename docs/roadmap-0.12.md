# ferroplan 0.12 roadmap — the game cycle

Scope locked 2026-07-20. 0.11 closed the guidance question honestly
(three transfers, three recorded negatives: the remaining IPC walls
need research-grade heuristic work, not reweightings), and the
budgeted-think API laid bare exactly what the ENGINE'S ACTUAL
CUSTOMER — the game, per the design answers on file — still can't do.
0.12 is the release where the engine starts earning its keep: the
corpus was the measuring stick; this cycle the stick has done its job.

The design answers this cycle serves:

- **Real-time with episodic stop-and-think**: an agent thinks at REST
  POINTS (a bounded `replan_budgeted` call), then FOLLOWS the plan;
  the world may drift mid-follow.
- **Genuine concurrency exists**: durative actions and the
  decision-epoch machinery are load-bearing for the game — yet
  `Session` REJECTS temporal domains today. The think API only works
  on classical worlds.
- **Barter economy, any item to any item**: item×item exchange actions
  make GROUNDING SCALE the binding constraint — the same lever behind
  the recorded elevator-11 tail (the ~4 GB stratum-1 enumeration
  transient).

## Phase 1 — the temporal Session

`Session::new` on a durative domain: snap-compile + ground ONCE (the
stratified path), then every `replan`/`replan_budgeted` is a bounded
temporal solve from the CURRENT world state, handing back a timed
plan.

- **Design call, on the record**: a session's world state between
  thinks is AT REST — no running intervals. Episodic stop-and-think
  means the agent plans at decision points; mid-interval state is the
  game's business, not the planner's. Concretely: the temporal solve
  seeds an EMPTY agenda, and `set_fact` rejects the compiler-reserved
  `RUNNING-*` tokens exactly as it rejects static facts (a game
  wanting to model an in-flight action mirrors its END effects when
  it completes).
- TILs: rejected in-session for now (a TIL pins the absolute clock;
  session thinks are clock-relative). Logged as a follow-up if the
  game ever needs scheduled exogenous events.
- The budget surface carries over whole: eval budget bounds every
  pass of the temporal ladder, the memory target plumbs to
  `temporal_node_cap`, a budget-exhausted think returns `solved:
  false` straight, and t1 ≡ t8 (suite-enforced, like the classical
  think test).
- Acceptance: a concurrency-using fixture (two agents, overlapping
  durative work) grounds once, thinks bounded, returns a VALIDATED
  timed plan, replans after `set_fact`/`set_fluent` drift; the
  `game_think` example grows a temporal act; suite determinism test.

## Phase 2 — drift-stable replanning (follow before you rethink)

A game agent whose world shifts slightly mid-plan must not thrash to a
structurally different plan. The cheap, high-value fix:

- **`Session::still_valid(plan, from_step)`** (name settled at
  implementation): replay the plan's remaining suffix against the
  CURRENT session state — the internal validator's replay machinery,
  pointed at a suffix. If the suffix still runs and lands on the goal,
  the agent keeps following it for FREE (no search, no think budget
  spent); only a broken suffix triggers a real rethink.
- Measured deliverable: a scripted drift fixture (N ticks, occasional
  irrelevant drift, occasional plan-breaking drift) reporting
  thinks-spent and plan-churn with and without the suffix check.
- Acceptance: irrelevant drift costs zero search; breaking drift is
  caught exactly (no false "still valid"); determinism unchanged.

## Phase 3 — grounding at barter scale (reachability-interleaved)

The one big engine project of the cycle, serving both masters: the
game's item×item exchange actions and the recorded elevator-11 tail
(stratum-1 START enumeration: ~4 GB transient, most of the grounding
wall). Today Phase B enumerates typed cross-products per action and
prunes after; the fix is enumerating FROM REACHED FACTS instead —
candidates exist only once their preconditions' dynamic atoms have
producers, interleaving reachability with enumeration.

- Fixtures first: a barter stress domain (K item types × M holders,
  generic `trade any-for-any`) alongside elevator-11 p04+ — measure
  raw-candidate counts, transient RSS, and wall before touching code.
- The bar: elevator-11's grounding transient and time drop
  materially; the barter fixture grounds within a think-sized budget;
  classical/temporal corpus paths UNCHANGED (the equivalence gate:
  identical plans and eval counts across a representative sweep, the
  compaction cycle's own discipline).
- Honest exit: if the interleaved rewrite can't hold the equivalence
  gate inside this cycle, ship the fixtures + measurements + a
  recorded design, not a half-landed grounder.

## Recorded — Phase 3 (2026-07-20): SHIPPED, the measurements chose the design

Fixtures first, as prescribed — and they split the question clean:

- **bazaar** (vendored: 12 holders × 40 items, any-for-any trade):
  DENSE-reachable — 197k of the 211k typed candidates are real ops.
  Interleaving can't help here by construction; the game answer is
  GROUND-ONCE (5.5 s / 644 MB at world load, then thinks are pure
  search). Classified, logged, viable.
- **elevator-11 p04**: enumerated ~100× its reachable set — 11.1 GB
  unstratified / 5.7 GB stratified transient for a 16,728-op task.
  Sparse-reachable: exactly where reached-restriction wins.

**Reached-restricted fixpoint grounding shipped** (`ground_fixpoint`;
`FF_NO_FIXPOINT_GROUND=1` falls back to stratified; classical entry
untouched): every action joins its positive dynamic top-level literals
against the reached-atom set, rounds to fixpoint, bindings deduped
across rounds; the producer-known stratification is subsumed. p04 A/B
same-binary back-to-back: **31.6 s / 5.7 GB → 6.9 s / 48.8 MB (~117×
transient), identical task dims**; equivalence spots exact (crew /
elev08 / openstacks / pegsol makespans identical on/off); suite 148/0.

**Scoped in release week — the order lottery bit back.** The 0.12.0
scoreboard refresh with fixpoint as the temporal default read
377/630 against 0.11's 387, and a same-box same-binary A/B pinned the
cause: sokoban-t stratified 4/10 against fixpoint 1/10 on i1–i10. The
surviving op set is identical, but doomed candidates never get
enumerated, so they no longer intern atoms early — fact-id
first-reference order shifts, and sokoban-t's tie-break-sensitive
search moves right along with it. A final canonical-order emission
pass did NOT claw the instances back: the residual is the interning
order itself, unrecoverable without re-paying the enumeration the
fixpoint exists to dodge. Resolution: the corpus solve paths stay on
stratified grounding (0.11 tie-breaks reproduced; sokoban i1/i5/i6
verified restored), and the `Session`'s temporal entry grounds via
fixpoint — the game track, where the memory win is the point and no
scoreboard baseline gets disturbed.

Residual, on the record: elevator-11 coverage stays 3/20 at 30 s —
under fixpoint the wall MOVED from grounding to search (p05 solves
solo at 49 s, formerly a grounding OOM; p04 is search-bound past
90 s), but that observation now lives on the Session path, not the
corpus default. The tail joins the recorded guidance family; the
grounding lever is spent, and it paid exactly what the fixtures said
it would — for the customer it was built for.

## Phase 4 — corpus debts (small, bounded)

- **parc-printer-t diagnosis**: 18/30 + 7/20 is the one temporal
  plateau never actually diagnosed. One instrumented afternoon:
  classify (guidance / scale / semantics / plumbing), log it, fix
  only if the classification hands us something cheap.
- **Reference-cost quality scoring**: vendor best-known costs for the
  vendored subset so the runner can report a real IPC quality score
  (the docstring's own caveat about summed cost).
- **turn-and-open at realistic budgets**: measure the full variant at
  60 s / 120 s solo-equivalent budgets so the record reflects what
  the 0.10 keys actually bought (i1 solves in ~25 s; the 30 s / 3-job
  methodology clips the family short).

## Recorded — Phase 4 (2026-07-20): debts paid, diagnoses filed

- **parc-printer-t DIAGNOSED** (the never-classified plateau): the
  complete pass drowns in start-spam — avg ~2,076 pending intervals
  per node (the TMS interleaving family; the mechanism is precise
  now). The cheap completeness-preserving experiment (an agenda-size
  ordering term on the complete pass's key, `FF_TAGENDA_W`) measured
  NEGATIVE at 30 s; knob stays opt-in, diagnosis on the record.
- **Self-relative quality scoring shipped**: `ipc67.py
  --score-against PRIOR.jsonl` computes the IPC formula against a
  prior run's per-instance costs — regression tracking, explicitly
  labeled NOT an official IPC score (the corpus carries no reference
  costs). Smoke: crew 5/5, quality 5.00 against the 0.10 run.
- **turn-and-open at realistic budgets**: 0/20 at 60 s (jobs-2 +
  today's slow box), 1/20 at 120 s (i1 at 77 s, val-green) —
  search-bound, the guidance family, exactly as classified in 0.10.

## Phase 5 — 0.12.0 release mechanics

CHANGELOG `[0.12.0]`, workspace bump 0.11.0 → 0.12.0, README refresh,
`rustup update stable` first, and the FULL gate — fmt, clippy
`-D warnings`, suite, AND `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc
--no-deps` (the 0.11.0 publish caught the doc pass missing from the
working gate; RELEASING.md already called for it). Scoreboards
refreshed where phases moved them; main publish.sh-ready.

## Recorded — Phase 5 (2026-07-20): shipped; the scoreboard defended itself

Full pre-flight green on latest stable (fmt, clippy `--all-targets
--all-features -D warnings`, suite 148/0, doc `-D warnings`, bench
`--no-run`); the `ferroplan-py` re-lock (a RELEASING.md step quietly
missed since 0.9) caught and fixed.

**The scoreboard stands at 387/630 — and it caught two things.** The
release refresh with fixpoint as the temporal default read 377, and a
same-box A/B pinned real sokoban-t coverage loss (the order lottery;
Phase 3's own record) — fixed by scoping fixpoint to the Session entry
alone. The post-fix refresh then read 372 on a day the box ran
1.5–2× slower than the 387 run (per-solve wall clock up across every
family; the recorded box-variance caveat, at its worst). Attribution,
done the honest way: the 0.11.0 binary was rebuilt from its cut
commit and run back-to-back against the 0.12 binary on the same box —
crew, sokoban, and all three elevator variants, **180 instances, ZERO
differences** in solved sets, per-instance costs, or VAL verdicts. The
corpus solve paths measure bit-equivalent to 0.11, exactly as the
scoping fix intends, so the committed 387/630 table (all
VAL-validated) stands as the truthful scoreboard; a slow-box table
would only be recording the weather, not the planner.

## Deferred, on the record

- **Red-black planning / semantic landmarks over numeric structure**:
  the recorded different-h lever for transport/storage/TMS/model-train
  — a research cycle for when the scoreboard matters again, now with
  three dead ends fenced off (roadmap-0.11 records).
- **TMS interleaving scale** (~47 pending ends/node): likely needs
  end-batching or symmetry reduction over identical concurrent
  intervals; not this cycle.
- **Session TILs** (absolute-clock exogenous events): only if the
  game's design turns out to need them.
