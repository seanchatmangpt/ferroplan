# THE 0.25 CUT SWEEP — the standing TWENTY-TWO boards, with ONE tier
# move (docs/roadmap-0.25.md Phase 5): ipc5-time and ipc5-metric-time,
# the last two 30 s boards on a 60 s table, sweep at 60 s from this
# cycle on. The 0.23 mechanism carries it: ipc67.py stamps `budget`
# per row, classify() prefers the stamp, and promote-air25.sh flips
# the SWEEPS registry fields at promote time. Staged in
# benchmarks/air25/ (the NEW boards stage separately in
# benchmarks/air25-entries/ via entries25-sweeps.sh — two sweeps, two
# headlines, by design).
#
# WHAT IS NEW THIS CYCLE, ON THE RECORD BEFORE THE SWEEP RUNS:
#
# 1. THE CONFLICT-RATE BAIL is live on promoted SAT rows
#    (FF_NO_SAT_RATEBAIL restores): match-cellar-family rows read
#    ~1-18 s instead of ~30 s — the refund, not noise.
# 2. THE PAIRING GUARD + LAYER GENERALIZATION are live in the CEGAR
#    loop (the guard is a soundness fix and has no hatch;
#    FF_NO_SAT_LAYERGEN restores single observed clauses). Watch the
#    temporal boards' zero-block rows against the field file.
# 3. THE PREFERENCE TIERS are live on any soft-constraint row
#    (complex-preferences machinery; the standing 22 carry none, but
#    the router change is global — watch ipc5-constraints for parity).
# 4. THE TIER MOVE: ipc5-time (77/130 @30s) and ipc5-metric-time
#    (54/200 @30s) measure at 60 s — their movement column at the cut
#    must carry the budget change, not read as engine gain.
#
# BEFORE running this:
#   1. The box must be otherwise QUIET (the standing 0.21 conditions).
#   2. benchmarks/opt-differential.py --board-budget must be GREEN on
#      this binary with a FRESH --out
#      (benchmarks/cut25/opt-differential-board.jsonl).
#   3. The binary must be the cut candidate: cargo build --release,
#      version 0.25.0 (the build step below checks the version
#      string).
#
# Resume-aware: per-board .done markers in benchmarks/air25/. Re-running is
# always safe.

# --- measurement hygiene (0.21: learned the hard way) ------------------------
# A dev thread compiling on this box starves a sweep: four parallel `cargo test
# --all --release` jobs took elevator-2011 i10 from 22s to 122s. A board measured
# under that is not a slow board, it is a WRONG board, and the v0.18 backfill lost
# one to exactly this. So: never START a board under load, and never MARK DONE a
# board that was contaminated while it ran — leave it for the resume pass.
