# Temporal benchmark results (real IPC domains, validated with VAL)

Time is the hard part — durative actions overlap, drift, and punish anything
sloppy about ordering. ferroplan run on **19 real IPC temporal domains**
(IPC-2002 → IPC-2014, durative actions), with **every produced plan validated
by [VAL]**, the standard IPC plan validator, under PDDL2.1 continuous-time
semantics (`-t 0.001` ε-tolerance).

Harness: [`bench_temporal.py`](bench_temporal.py). Budget: 20 instances/domain,
**10 s** each, single-threaded. VAL and the benchmark instances are not vendored
(licence/size) — see [`COMPARING.md`](COMPARING.md).

## Headline

- **Soundness: 44 / 45 produced plans are VAL-valid (98%).** ferroplan's temporal
  semantics — snap-action compilation, `over all` invariants, required
  concurrency, and **ε-separation** — hold up under an outside witness. (Testing
  against VAL is what surfaced the ε-separation gap in the first place, now fixed.)
- **Coverage is search-limited, not a soundness problem.** At a 10 s budget, 45
  of ~368 instances solve; the rest time out *or the decision-epoch search
  exhausts without a plan*. That's the clear next target — temporal search
  performance and guidance, not parsing or validity.

## Findings

1. **ε-separation works — the main result.** Before the STN re-timing pass,
   *every* non-trivial plan came back VAL-rejected: a start colliding with the
   at-end effect it depended on, two events claiming the same instant. After
   the pass, 44/45 validate clean. Required-concurrency (match-cellar) and
   back-to-back durative chains (driverlog) are VAL-valid.

2. **Coverage is bottlenecked by the temporal search, not budget.** A 60 s probe
   still fails: depots/inst-1 searches 54 s and gives up; match-cellar-2014/inst-1
   *exhausts in 2.7 s* on a solvable instance. The decision-epoch search +
   relaxed heuristic doesn't scale or guide well on many temporal instances
   (no temporal EHC; the relaxed-plan heuristic ignores time/concurrency). This is
   the next temporal work item.

3. **One parse gap:** `rovers-metric-time` uses `?duration` inside a numeric
   effect (`(increase (energy ?x) (* ?duration (recharge-rate ?x)))`) — a
   duration-dependent (continuous-style) effect ferroplan does not parse. 1 of 19
   domains.

4. **One invalid plan:** `openstacks-time/instance-2` — the ε-separation pass
   models mutexes over unconditional add/del/precondition only, so an ADL
   *conditional*-effect mutex (ship-order's conditional delete) slips through.
   Rare (1/45); fixing it means extending mutex detection to conditional/numeric
   effects.
   *Resolved (verified 2026-07-22, 0.14 extension Phase 7):* the 0.10
   ε-separation rewrite replaced the pairwise mutex test with TOTAL ε-ordering
   (every consecutive happening ε apart — simultaneity impossible by
   construction, so no footprint model can under-approximate again).
   `openstacks-time/instance-2` re-solved and VAL-validated green
   (`-t 0.001`, 30 steps).
