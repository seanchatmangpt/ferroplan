"""Regenerate benchmarks/ipc-standings.md — the one-table-per-competition
standings document (0.16 Phase 1 deliverable; scripted per RELEASING.md
discipline: scoreboards defend themselves).

Inputs (all optional — missing files are marked "not swept" / "in flight"):
  - raw per-instance JSONLs from ipc67.py sweeps (untracked working data):
      ipc5-prop / ipc5-time / ipc5-metric-time / ipc5-constraints
      ipc67-default (seq-sat) / ipc67-temporal (tempo-sat) / ipc67-netben
      ipc7-mco-t{2,4,8}
  - benchmarks/IPC5-results.tgz — the vendored official IPC-5 results
    archive (see ATTRIBUTION.md): reference plans with MetricValue headers.

Quality scoring, by track semantics:
  - IPC-5 propositional: plan LENGTH vs the archive field's plan lengths
    (action lines counted per .soln — NrActions headers are often empty).
    IPC-2008-style quality ratio (best/ours) plus W/T/L vs best-of-field.
  - IPC-5 preference tracks: already reference-scored on their own boards
    (ipc5-scoreboard.md, ipc5-qualitative-scoreboard.md) — linked, not
    recomputed here.
  - IPC-5 time / metric-time / constraints: coverage-only. The honest
    reason, on the record: the runner does not record MAKESPAN (the
    track's quality currency) — a named runner debt, not an archive gap.
  - IPC-6/7 tracks: coverage (+ VAL) against standing baselines; no
    official per-instance archive is vendored for 2008/2011.

Failure classes per unsolved instance (from the JSONL):
  timeout (elapsed >= 90% of budget — including graceful engine exits
  AT an armed FF_TIME_LIMIT wall; 90 because the refill loop's re-entry
  floor is 10% of wall, so nothing between 90% and the wall can be a
  give-up), mem-cap (notes), engine-reject/error (a named mechanism:
  parse/feature reject, grounding verdict, nonzero exit, or a legacy
  pre-0.20 row with no elapsed recorded), else early-exit (search gave
  up with wall budget left — the class the 0.20 refill loop emptied;
  0.21 closed the residual [90%, 95%) boundary sliver by moving the
  line here to the refill floor).
