# THE 0.25 ENTRIES SWEEP — the nine NEW boards only (docs/roadmap-0.25.md
# Phase 1: the table grows). Deliberately a SEPARATE sweep from the
# standing twenty-two: entries have no before/after, so the cut sweep
# keeps its like-for-like identity and the cut record carries two
# headlines by design. Staged in benchmarks/air25-entries/; promotion
# rides the 0.25 promote script when it exists.
#
# THE NINE, WITH WHAT EACH ONE IS:
#   ipc2014-mco-t2 / ipc2014-mco-t8 — the two missing 2014 multi-core
#     tiers (corpus was on disk all along; t4 reads 163/280).
#   ipc2018-opt — the 2018 dataset's opt/ half, first proof board there.
#   ipc2023-sat / ipc2023-opt — the REAL 2023 classical tracks (the
#     standing "2023 classical" board is the agile corpus at 60 s,
#     flagged baseline since 0.17).
#   ipc2023-numeric-opt — the numeric corpus under Mode::Optimal: the
#     track whose official field CSV (ipc-2023n/results/opt.csv) was
#     vendored with the corpus and never had a board to referee.
#   ipc2026-opt-full — the official 13-domain/260 Overall Optimal
#     constituency (the standing 3-pair board stays as the slice).
#   ipc5-simple-pref / ipc5-qual-pref — the 2006 preference tracks at
#     full corpus (the curated 8-instance reference boards keep their
#     own files). Coverage = hard-goal solves; the preference metric
#     rides in the raw for the quality sitting.
#
# NOT here: complex-pref-2006 — its engine entry is Phase 2; a canary
# before that lands is expected red and proves nothing.
#
# BEFORE running this: the box must be otherwise QUIET (the standing
# 0.21 conditions), and the binary must be the 0.25 dev head (the build
# step below checks the version string). Entries are first measurements,
# not movements — but a contaminated first column poisons every future
# delta, so the contention discipline is identical to a cut sweep.
#
# Resume-aware: per-board .done markers in benchmarks/air25-entries/.
# Re-running is always safe.
