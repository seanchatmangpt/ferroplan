# IPC standings — one honest table per competition, no chrome

Cut by `python3 benchmarks/standings.py`. Don't touch it by hand —
regenerate after every sweep. Feeds are the per-instance JSONLs and
the vendored official IPC-5 archive; the module docstring carries
the scoring semantics and the failure-class taxonomy.

| 2023 agile ENTRY (300s) | yes (OFFICIAL-BUDGET entry, 0.19) | 50/140 | OFFICIAL 300 s budget — a competition-methodology ENTRY, not a baseline | 4 engine-reject/error, 2 mem-cap, 84 timeout |
| 2023 numeric | yes (first entry, 0.17) | 243/400 | field CSVs vendored (ipc-2023n/results) — per-domain comparison in the audit record | 9 early-exit, 1 engine-reject/error, 147 timeout, 37 solved VAL-unavailable (engine-oracle only; see benchmarks/val-availability.py) |
| 2023 numeric-opt | yes (FIRST ENTRY, 0.25 — the table grows) | 81/400 | coverage = PROOF RATE over the numeric corpus; the track's official field CSV (ipc-2023n/results/opt.csv) is the vs-field referee | 139 early-exit, 1 engine-reject/error, 45 mem-cap, 134 timeout, 3 solved VAL-unavailable (engine-oracle only; see benchmarks/val-availability.py) |
| 2026 numeric (first board) | yes (FIRST ENTRY, 0.20 — new corpus) | 217/320 | coverage + VAL; the corpus ships -sat/-opt domain PAIRS, all swept satisficing-style on this first board | 2 mem-cap, 101 timeout, 10 solved VAL-unavailable (engine-oracle only; see benchmarks/val-availability.py) |
| 2026 numeric-opt | yes (FIRST ENTRY, 0.21 — the -opt pairs, ⚖️) | 22/60 | coverage = PROOF RATE (Mode::Optimal over the three -opt pairs; LENGTH optima — the vendored corpus carries no active :metric; every certificate VAL-checked) | 38 timeout |
| 2026 numeric-opt FULL | yes (FIRST ENTRY, 0.25 — the table grows) | 80/260 | coverage = PROOF RATE over the official 13-domain/260 Overall Optimal constituency (the 3-pair board above is the like-for-like slice) | 102 early-exit, 4 mem-cap, 74 timeout |

The 2023 classical corpus runs its agile instances at the standard 60 s satisficing clock — the competition's own agile budget is 300 s, so these rows stand marked BASELINE, not entry. No pretending otherwise.
