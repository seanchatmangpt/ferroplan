# IPC standings — one honest table per competition, no chrome

Cut by `python3 benchmarks/standings.py`. Don't touch it by hand —
regenerate after every sweep. Feeds are the per-instance JSONLs and
the vendored official IPC-5 archive; the module docstring carries
the scoring semantics and the failure-class taxonomy.

## IPC-5 (2006)

| track | entered | coverage | quality | failure classes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| propositional | cloud-era board, NOT re-baselined — see git history | — | — | — |
| time | cloud-era board, NOT re-baselined — see git history | — | — | — |
| metric-time | cloud-era board, NOT re-baselined — see git history | — | — | — |
| constraints | cloud-era board, NOT re-baselined — see git history | — | — | — |
| simple-preferences | yes | see board | reference-scored — [`ipc5-scoreboard.md`](ipc5-scoreboard.md) | — |
| qualitative-preferences | yes | see board | reference-scored — [`ipc5-qualitative-scoreboard.md`](ipc5-qualitative-scoreboard.md) (24W/4T/10L vs SGPlan5 — ahead of the winner; rovers/storage/tpp won outright) | — |
| complex-preferences | no (modal operators rejected by name) | — | — | feature gap, on the deferred list |

## IPC-6 (2008)

| track | entered | coverage | quality | failure classes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| seq-sat | yes | 276/300 | coverage + VAL (no official per-instance archive vendored) | 24 timeout |
| tempo-sat | yes | 297/390 | coverage + VAL (no official per-instance archive vendored) | 1 mem-cap, 92 timeout |
| net-benefit | cloud-era board, NOT re-baselined — see git history | — | — | — |
| seq-opt | yes (first entry, 0.19 — Mode::Optimal) | 148/270 | coverage = PROOF RATE (A* + admissible LM-cut, h^max sprint first; every plan certified + VAL) | 122 timeout |
| tempo-opt | out of scope by design (satisficing temporal path) | — | — | — |

## IPC-7 (2011)

| track | entered | coverage | quality | failure classes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| seq-sat | yes | 210/280 | coverage + VAL | 70 timeout |
| tempo-sat | yes | 119/240 | coverage + VAL | 7 mem-cap, 114 timeout |
| seq-mco t2 | cloud-era board, NOT re-baselined — see git history | — | wall-clock per competition rule (4-core box; t8 oversubscribed) | — |
| seq-mco t4 | cloud-era board, NOT re-baselined — see git history | — | wall-clock per competition rule (4-core box; t8 oversubscribed) | — |
| seq-mco t8 | cloud-era board, NOT re-baselined — see git history | — | wall-clock per competition rule (4-core box; t8 oversubscribed) | — |
| seq-opt | yes (first entry, 0.19 — Mode::Optimal) | 127/280 | coverage = PROOF RATE (A* + admissible LM-cut, h^max sprint first; every plan certified + VAL) | 153 timeout |

## The modern corpora (IPC 2014 / 2018 / 2023 — first entered 0.17)

| track | entered | coverage | quality | failure classes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2014 seq-sat | yes (first entry, 0.17) | 138/280 | coverage + VAL | 1 mem-cap, 141 timeout |
| 2014 seq-agile | yes (first entry, 0.17) | 142/280 | coverage + VAL | 2 early-exit, 1 mem-cap, 135 timeout |
| 2014 tempo-sat | yes (first entry, 0.17) | 70/200 | coverage + VAL | 130 timeout |
| 2014 seq-mco t4 | cloud-era board, NOT re-baselined — see git history | — | — | — |
| 2014 seq-opt | yes (first entry, 0.19) | 58/256 | coverage = PROOF RATE (Mode::Optimal, A* + admissible LM-cut, h^max sprint first; every plan certified + VAL) | 198 timeout |
| 2018 seq-sat | yes (first entry, 0.17) | 70/240 | vs best-known bounds: 0W/1T/25L, mean quality 0.77 (26 scored) | 3 mem-cap, 167 timeout |
| 2023 classical | yes (first entry, 0.17) | 32/140 | vs best-known bounds: 0W/10T/22L, mean quality 0.80 (32 scored) | 108 timeout |
| 2023 agile ENTRY (300s) | yes (OFFICIAL-BUDGET entry, 0.19) | 51/140 | OFFICIAL 300 s budget — a competition-methodology ENTRY, not a baseline | 89 timeout |
| 2023 numeric | yes (first entry, 0.17) | 229/400 | field CSVs vendored (ipc-2023n/results) — per-domain comparison in the audit record | 1 VAL-RED, 3 early-exit, 1 engine-reject/error, 3 mem-cap, 163 timeout |
| 2026 numeric (first board) | yes (FIRST ENTRY, 0.20 — new corpus) | 165/320 | coverage + VAL; the corpus ships -sat/-opt domain PAIRS, all swept satisficing-style on this first board | 155 timeout |
| 2026 numeric-opt | yes (FIRST ENTRY, 0.21 — the -opt pairs, ⚖️) | 21/60 | coverage = PROOF RATE (Mode::Optimal over the three -opt pairs; LENGTH optima — the vendored corpus carries no active :metric; every certificate VAL-checked) | 9 early-exit, 30 timeout |

The 2023 classical corpus runs its agile instances at the standard 60 s satisficing clock — the competition's own agile budget is 300 s, so these rows stand marked BASELINE, not entry. No pretending otherwise.
