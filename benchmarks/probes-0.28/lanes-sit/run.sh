# The 0.28 S/I/T lanes, measured on the boards they were built for -- and on
# the two temporal boards they were NOT built for (the regression read).
#
# ONE attempt per row, 2-wide, threads 1, 60 s: the board harness, the board
# wall. The comparison column is the PUBLISHED board, which is best-of-N
# (docs/roadmap-0.28.md, THE INSTRUMENT), so a single attempt here is the
# conservative side of every delta. A row the new engine LOSES is re-run on
# the old binary under the same conditions before it is called a loss
# (differential.sh) -- equal-N where it matters, not everywhere.
#
# A MEASUREMENT: writes here, touches no published board. Nothing else should
# be using the CPU while it runs (no cargo, no second sweep).
