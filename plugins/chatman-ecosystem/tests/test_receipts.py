"""Gall checkpoint receipts, and the promotion law as a computation.

A Gall checkpoint is "the smallest closed, receipted transformation proving one
complete category transition with explicit inputs, outputs, refusals, and
verification" (mfw `15-galls-law-evolutionary-construction.omdoc:37`).

Two rules from the sibling repositories are enforced here rather than trusted:

* wasm4pm's **promotion law** -- ALIVE requires exact revision, clean checkout,
  positive witness, negative falsifier, deterministic result, and replay
  *outside the originating session*. A checkpoint may not certify itself.
* bcinr's **falsifier rule** -- the falsifier must be "a genuine
  Gall-checkpoint negative fixture, not a comment describing one". A string
  naming a test that does not exist must not pass.

Note what these tests deliberately do NOT do: they never run a witness command
and write its result back into a receipt. That would let a checkpoint certify
itself inside the session that produced it, which is exactly what the promotion
law forbids. CI checks shape, agreement, and the law; `replayed_outside_session`
is set by a distinct run.
