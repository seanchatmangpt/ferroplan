Validate `$ARGUMENTS` without editing.

Exercise the exact claimed surfaces using distinct authorities where
available:

- claude-code-config-lsp conformance;
- Cargo format/check/Clippy/tests;
- Ferroplan plan replay;
- external VAL or another independent semantic implementation when required;
- canonical digest and receipt verification.

Return structured JSON containing `valid`, exact commands/tools, inputs,
outputs, executable identity when available, failures, independence
class, and maximum lawful standing.

Failures found here get named, not fixed — repair is somebody else's
skill.
