Design or validate `$ARGUMENTS`.

1. Read `profiles/config-schema-epoch.json`.
2. Run `claude plugin validate` against the plugin root when Claude Code is available.
3. Collect `claude-code-config-lsp` diagnostics, completion/hover facts, virtual health, and Declare traces for modeled surfaces.
4. Classify every disagreement as known epoch delta, unknown delta, loader error, or LSP-modeled error.
5. Compute legal component combinations and the law rejecting each illegal combination.
6. Return the minimum ontology/profile/config change and whether `conformance=conformant` may lawfully be admitted.

The current loader governs loadability. The LSP governs only its modeled
epoch. Neither one proves semantic correctness on its own. No editing
happens inside this skill.
