description: Inspect and advance the Chatman combinatorial phase vector using exact MCP receipts. Use when repository work changes epistemic, allocation, planning, actuation, drift, or configuration standing.

Operate the phase engine for `$ARGUMENTS`.

1. Read `profiles/phase-space.json` and run:
   ```sh
   python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/phase.py" status --project "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
   ```
2. Read the pending observation ledger:
   ```sh
   python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/loop.py" pending --project "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"
   ```
3. Invoke only the agents and skills active in the current phase projection.
4. Obtain authoritative MCP evidence for every requested advancement.
5. Audit the target vector against every invariant.
6. Advance dimensions only with a 64-hex admission receipt and its envelope:
   ```sh
   python3 "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/phase.py" transition \
     --project "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" \
     --set <dimension>=<state> \
     --receipt <receipt> \
     --envelope <path-to-envelope.json> \
     --reason <reason>
   ```
   `--envelope` is the JSON admission envelope returned by
   `bind_plan_receipt`/`bind_allocation_receipt` (its `receipt` field must
   equal `--receipt`); `phase.py transition` calls `verify_receipt` on it
   before advancing.
7. Never mistake the phase state itself for execution proof. The phase
   runtime is a projection cast over authoritative receipts — a shadow,
   not the object casting it.

A repository mutation automatically collapses the vector to observed,
unallocated, unplanned, sealed, drifted, and conformance-unknown.
Re-establish only the dimensions new evidence actually supports.
