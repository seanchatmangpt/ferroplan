Audit `$ARGUMENTS`.

- Read the hook ledger, phase vector, allocation envelope, plan envelope, validator result, and predecessor chain.
- Recompute every canonical digest with `verify_receipt` and `canonical_digest`.
- Check event counts, chain continuity, authority claim ceilings, and phase invariants.
- Return the maximum lawful Gall standing and every missing obligation.

This is read-only work. No editing, planning, allocating, or publishing
happens here.
