Allocate scarce capacity for `$ARGUMENTS`.

Require an admitted observation frontier and exactly eight candidates in
the factor order declared by `profiles/work-surfaces.json`.

1. Call `cmca_allocate` with the exact candidates.
2. Call `bind_allocation_receipt` with candidates, allocation result, observation frontier, and predecessor receipt.
3. Call `verify_receipt` on the envelope.
4. Return exact shares, digests, BCINR revision, receipt, and refusals.

This skill measures capacity — it does not plan or execute work.
Allocation standing buys no actuation authority.
