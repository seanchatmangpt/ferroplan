description: Manufacture a new Claude Code operating capability by composing existing phase dimensions, agents, skills, hooks, MCP authorities, and configuration laws. Use when a fixed workflow is insufficient or a new plugin behavior is requested.

Compose a capability for `$ARGUMENTS` using design for combinatorial
maximalism.

1. Enumerate the smallest orthogonal primitives already present.
2. Read `profiles/phase-space.json`; select a lawful product-state combination.
3. Compute the union of active capabilities, agents, and skills.
4. Identify missing primitives rather than inventing a monolithic workflow.
5. Express missing law in the ontology, SHACL, Declare constraints, phase profile, PDDL operators, or typed MCP schema.
6. Use `claude-code-config-lsp` to validate the proposed cross-file configuration.
7. Preserve reversibility: every composition must decompose into independently inspectable components.
8. Preserve authority: composition cannot raise any component above its claim ceiling.

Return the selected combination, rejected combinations, new primitive
requirements, projection changes, and exact conformance obligations. No
editing happens inside this skill — only the design of what could be
built.
