"""Transcribe the five drifting registries into benchmarks/manifest.toml.

Today the same board is described in five places that can disagree:

  benchmarks/standings.py   SWEEPS          raw.jsonl -> (label, competition, budget)
                            AIR_REBASELINED which box produced it
                            PROOF_TRACKS    coverage IS proof rate
                            MD_FOR          the .md naming exceptions
  benchmarks/ipc67.py       TRACK_PATTERNS  regex over corpus variant dirs
                            TRACK_IPCS      which ipc-YYYY dirs to scan
  benchmarks/cut25-sweeps.sh    BOARDS=()   the standing 22
  benchmarks/entries25-sweeps.sh BOARDS=()  the 0.25 entries
  benchmarks/post-entries25.sh              the board the entries sweep missed

This reads all of them and emits ONE file. It is a transcription, not a new
source of truth: run with --check after any registry edit and it will refuse
to agree if the manifest has drifted from the Python.

    python3 crucible/tools/gen-manifest.py [--check]

Two TRACK_PATTERNS entries use negative lookbehind, which Rust's `regex`
crate cannot compile by design (it costs the linear-time guarantee). They are
emitted as include/exclude pairs, and the equivalence is PROVEN against every
variant directory on disk before the file is written -- see check_lookbehind.
