//! One thread owns the only read-write connection. Everything else asks it.
//!
//! SQLite in WAL mode tolerates many readers and exactly one writer, and the
//! cheapest way to guarantee the second half is to have only one. A single
//! writer also buys three things this harness specifically needs:
//!
//! * **Resolution is race-free by construction.** `variant`, `instance`,
//!   `board` and `engine` are all resolved SELECT-then-INSERT. On one thread
//!   that is atomic enough; on several it is a lost-update bug waiting for the
//!   first busy sweep -- and one of those tables (`variant`) has a UNIQUE that
//!   SQLite does not enforce over NULLs, so the database would not even catch
//!   it.
//! * **Batching without a queue of its own.** Samples arrive every twenty
//!   seconds and events in bursts; committing each one is a fsync the box does
//!   not need to do. They are collected up to [`BATCH_MAX`] or [`BATCH_WINDOW`]
//!   and written as one transaction.
//! * **A run row is never batched.** A completed run is the expensive thing --
//!   minutes to hours of computation that cannot be recovered by re-reading a
//!   file -- and never losing one to a crash is the entire premise of this
//!   project. It goes into its own transaction, immediately, and the caller
//!   waits for the commit. Sample and event rows are cheap and are allowed to
//!   be lost; a run row is not.
//!
//! The asymmetry is deliberate and is the reason the API is shaped the way it
//! is: [`WriterHandle::run`] returns a `Result` because it waited, while
//! [`WriterHandle::sample`] returns nothing because it did not.
