//! The database. This repo's first, and the four places its spec was wrong.
//!
//! `crucible-spec.md` §8 sketches a schema. The sketch is right about the
//! driver, the journal mode and the single writer, and wrong in four specific
//! ways -- each of which would have cost a number rather than an afternoon.
//! All four are fixed here, and the fixes are why this module exists at all
//! rather than being a transcription:
//!
//! **1. It keys the engine on `tag`.** The primary trigger for a sweep is an
//! UNTAGGED working-tree candidate, so `tag` is NULL in the normal case; and
//! `ver` is not unique either, because every dev build of a cycle reports the
//! same `ff 0.25.0`. Two builds reporting one version and producing different
//! coverage is precisely the comparison this harness exists to make, and a
//! version-keyed table cannot express it. The engine is keyed on the binary's
//! BLAKE3, supplied by the caller -- this crate hashes nothing itself, and does
//! not take a `blake3` dependency to do it.
//!
//! **2. There is no `board` concept.** The spec models a run as
//! `(tag, problem, config)`, which cannot express what the resume gate actually
//! compares. `ipc67.py:load_resume` reuses a prior row only when `ver`,
//! `budget`, `mode`, `jobs` and `threads` all match EXACTLY, so the unit of
//! work and of row identity is `(name, budget, mode, jobs, threads, env, args)`
//! and `board` carries a UNIQUE over exactly that tuple. A 30 s -> 60 s tier
//! move therefore creates a NEW board row, which is correct: it is a different
//! measurement, and `standings.py` denominates the timeout class in the row's
//! own budget. Merging the two would silently re-class every 30 s wall-exit as
//! an early-exit -- a lie in the one column the refill loop is refereed by.
//!
//! **3. `domain` and `problem` are the wrong nouns.** A "domain" in this repo
//! is a corpus VARIANT DIRECTORY (`elevator-sequential-satisficing`); several
//! variants share one PDDL domain file and some carry a per-instance one. And a
//! problem's key is an instance LABEL that is an integer for a
//! single-digit-group filename and an underscore-joined string (`"3_10_50_10"`)
//! otherwise -- collapsing multipart labels to their first group once put
//! `ipc2026-numeric`'s 320 rows under 288 keys. The label is stored as TEXT
//! with a `label_is_int` flag and a zero-padded `sort_key`, so `ORDER BY`
//! reproduces the Python's numeric-tuple sort exactly.
//!
//! **4. `validated INTEGER` flattens a tristate and drops the reason.** `val`
//! is NULL for UNAVAILABLE, 0 for REJECTED and 1 for valid, with a `val_reason`
//! beside it. **Every query touching `val` must use `IS NULL`, never `= 0`.**
//! That single confusion is three separate published-number incidents -- the
//! 0.20 table read 46/240 and 113/320 where the boards beside it said 53 and
//! 121, fifteen instances light, because domains VAL could not INGEST were
//! counted as domains VAL had REJECTED. The warning is repeated on the column
//! itself, where somebody writing a new query will actually be looking.
//!
//! # One thing the schema deliberately does not do
//!
//! It does not store a verdict. The spec's `state` column carries
//! `solved|unsolved|timeout|error|invalid`, which is a taxonomy -- and this
//! codebase already has exactly one, in `crucible_publish::Referee`, ported
//! line by line from `standings.py` with a test per incident. A second
//! taxonomy in SQL would drift from it, and the drift would be invisible until
//! a table disagreed with a board. `run.state` is the QUEUE state and nothing
//! more; classification happens where the tests are.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! * [`lock`] -- one crucible per database directory, enforced by `flock`.
//! * [`schema`] -- the DDL and the `user_version` ladder.
//! * [`writer`] -- the single thread that owns the one read-write connection.
//! * [`read`] -- `query_only` connections, and the canonical export order.
//! * [`rebuild`] -- the repo is the source of truth; this puts it in and takes
//!   it back out.
