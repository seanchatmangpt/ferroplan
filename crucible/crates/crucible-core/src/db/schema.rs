-- move creates a NEW board row rather than updating one. That is correct and
-- is the point: a row measured under a 60 s wall is a different measurement

-- as a fraction of the row's own budget. Merging them silently re-classes every

-- budget_secs is the ARMED wall -- the row's own `budget` stamp, i.e. ipc67's
