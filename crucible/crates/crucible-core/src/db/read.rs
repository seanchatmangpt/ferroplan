//! Read-only access, on a connection that is physically forbidden to write.
//!
//! `PRAGMA query_only=ON` rather than `SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY`, and the
//! difference matters: a read-only connection cannot recover a hot WAL, so
//! opening one against a database whose writer just died gives a stale or
//! failed read exactly when the answer matters most. The connection is opened
//! read-write so SQLite can do its recovery, and is then forbidden to write --
//! which is a guarantee about this handle, not about the file.
//!
//! # Export order
//!
//! `export_rows` orders by `variant.ipc, variant.name, instance.sort_key`, and
//! that order is a promise, not a convenience. `ipc67.py` writes a board in
//! corpus order -- IPC directory, then `sorted(os.listdir())` over variant
//! directories, then instances by numeric tuple -- while the crucible scheduler
//! reorders execution freely (tiering, retries, the clean-timing pass). Without
//! a canonical export order a crucible-produced raw could not be diffed against
//! a Python-produced one at all, and "the numbers agree" would have to be taken
//! on trust.
//!
//! Two details make that ORDER BY equal the Python's:
//!
//! * every `ipcs` list in `benchmarks/manifest.toml` is already in ascending
//!   order, so ordering by the ipc STRING agrees with iterating the manifest's
//!   list; and
//! * `sorted()` on `str` is codepoint order, which is byte order in UTF-8, so
//!   SQLite's default BINARY collation on variant names agrees with Python's.
//!
//! # `val` is a tristate
//!
//! Every query in this file that touches `val` uses `IS NULL` for unavailable
//! and `= 0` only for a genuine rejection. NULL is not a verdict. Reading it as
//! one is the 0.20, 0.21 and 0.23 incidents.
