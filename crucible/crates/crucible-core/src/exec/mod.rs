//! Spawn one planner, watch it, and account for its time honestly.
//!
//! Everything difficult about the runner is here, and every difficulty is
//! recorded in the Python this replaces:
//!
//! * **Draining the pipes.** `Child::try_wait()` in a poll loop WITHOUT reading
//!   stdout deadlocks the moment the child exceeds the 64 KiB pipe buffer,
//!   which `ff --json` does routinely on a long plan. Python's `communicate()`
//!   hides this; a naive port reintroduces it as a hang that only shows up on
//!   the boards with the biggest plans.
//! * **The effective clock.** A suspended run must not time out. Elapsed is
//!   wall minus accumulated suspension, and a machine sleep folds into the same
//!   accumulator -- which is why sleeping mid-run needs no separate machinery.
//! * **Kill semantics.** Deadline and memory-cap kills are an immediate
//!   `SIGKILL` to the process GROUP, matching `ipc67.py`'s bare `proc.kill()`.
//!   Adding the spec's five-second `SIGTERM` grace here would change the `time`
//!   recorded on every timeout row in the corpus. Escalation is reserved for
//!   operator cancellation, where no number is being recorded.
//! * **Groups, never bare pids.** A wedged planner with worker threads, or a
//!   VAL that forked, must not outlive its group.
//! * **Spawn retry.** A memory-bloated PREDECESSOR can make this instance's
//!   `fork()` fail. The 0.16 seq-mco sweep lost floor-tile i7-i12 to exactly
//!   that, logged as engine rejects. One retry after a breather; a second
//!   failure is recorded honestly as `spawn-fail`.
