//! The database is a CACHE. This is the test that says so.
//!
//! The repo's committed board raws are the durable record; the database is a
//! fast, queryable copy of them and a work queue. That claim is only worth
//! anything if a board can go in and come back out unchanged, so this file
//! takes `benchmarks/ipc2014-opt.jsonl` -- 256 real rows, git-tracked, so the
//! test is hermetic -- loads it, exports it, and compares BYTES with
//! `crucible_publish::write_row`.
//!
//! # Why there are two laps
//!
//! Lap 1 (file -> database -> bytes) can pass by luck. A lossy numeric column
//! survives one trip if the value it mangles happens to re-print the same way
//! -- a `time` stored as a float and re-formatted, a `metric` rounded to two
//! places that was already two places. Lap 2 feeds lap 1's output back in and
//! exports again: anything lossy has now been through the lossy step twice and
//! the two laps disagree. It is the cheapest available proof that the storage
//! layer is not quietly normalising measured values.
//!
//! The other properties tested here each defend a specific way this layer could
//! be wrong without anything failing:
//!
//! * a second crucible against a live database is two schedulers on one queue;
//! * a rebuilt run claiming `clean` timing manufactures the exact claim the
//!   contention watcher exists to refuse;
//! * an import that is not idempotent turns a restart into `attempt = 2` rows
//!   and doubles every board;
//! * `val = 0` and `val IS NULL` are different questions, and confusing them is
//!   three published-number incidents;
//! * the resume gate is now a SQL range query, and it has to fail CLOSED in
//!   every direction the Python fails closed in -- a gate that answers "clean"
//!   where the Python answered "re-run" stitches a contended row into a board
//!   and says nothing about it;
//! * a `live_child` row has to carry enough to prove identity, because a
//!   `killpg` on a recycled pgid kills a stranger.
