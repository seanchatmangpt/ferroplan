//! What happens AROUND a planner process, tested against a planner that does
//! exactly what it is told.
//!
//! Each test here defends a specific way this has gone wrong before, or a
//! specific way a naive port would go wrong:
//!
//!   * a supervisor that waits without draining the pipes deadlocks the moment
//!     the child exceeds the 64 KiB pipe buffer, which `ff --json` does
//!     routinely on a long plan -- and Python's communicate() hid it;
//!   * a suspended run that keeps counting wall time times out while stopped,
//!     which would turn every contention window into fabricated coverage loss;
//!   * a memory cap that measures address space on Darwin measures nothing at
//!     all, because the kernel refuses every setrlimit on RLIMIT_AS;
//!   * a kill aimed at a bare pid leaves the process group behind.
