//! The sweep: what the shell drivers did, without the shell.
//!
//! `cut25-sweeps.sh` is 194 lines that wait for a quiet box, start a contention
//! watcher, hand a board to a Python runner, read a verdict back out of a JSON
//! file through three separate `python3 -c` invocations, and either touch a
//! `.done` marker or leave the board for the next pass. This is that, with the
//! atom moved from a BOARD to an INSTANCE -- which is the whole point, because
//! the contention that kills a two-hour board is usually a ten-minute window in
//! the middle of it, and everything measured either side of that window was
//! fine.
//!
//! The organising rule, stated once: **contention may cost a timing number; it
//! must never cost hours of computation.** So every row measured is kept and
//! written, marked dirty when the box was not quiet, and a board is banked only
//! when every one of its instances has a CLEAN row. Nothing is discarded; work
//! is owed, not lost.
//!
//! # The database is the truth; the JSONL is an export
//!
//! Every measured instance is committed to the database in its own
//! transaction the moment its run finishes -- BEFORE the box is asked whether
//! the run was clean, before the artifacts are rewritten, before anything else
//! happens. That commit is the `kill -9` receipt: a restarted sweep opens the
//! same database, reads back every row and every clean verdict, and owes
//! exactly the instances that never got one. The stage's `.jsonl` is
//! regenerated from those rows, which is what makes it an export rather than a
//! second record that could disagree.
//!
//! Cleanliness is the per-sample window intersection over the watcher's
//! box-wide timeline (`Reader::window_gate`), the same rule `ipc67.py`'s
//! `load_resume` applies to a conditions file -- and not the before/after
//! sample pair the first cut of this driver used, which could not see a
//! ten-minute spike in the middle of a five-minute instance.
//!
//! `--no-db` restores that first cut exactly: no database, no watcher thread,
//! no engine stamp on the rows, pair-judged cleanliness. It is the hatch, and
//! it is kept so the off-path artifacts stay bit-identical to what the
//! pre-database binary wrote.
