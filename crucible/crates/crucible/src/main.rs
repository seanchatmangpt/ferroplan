//! `crucible` -- the resident benchmark sweep harness for ferroplan.
//!
//! Replaces a pile of shell drivers, a Python runner, a contention watcher and
//! a standings generator with one supervised process that owns the sweep end to
//! end. The design record is `crucible-spec.md`; the corrections to it, and the
//! decisions this cycle made, are in `docs/roadmap-0.26.md`.
//!
//! The organising rule for the whole program: **contention may cost a timing
//! number; it must never cost hours of computation.** Everything measured is
//! kept, marked dirty when the box was not quiet, and a board is only banked
//! and only publishable once every one of its rows is clean.
