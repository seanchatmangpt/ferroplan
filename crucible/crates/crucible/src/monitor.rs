//! THE DASHBOARD, BUILT FROM THE DATABASE (0.28).
//!
//! Until now the dashboard existed only INSIDE a running `crucible sweep`:
//! the TUI hosted the sweep, so the one way to watch was to be the process
//! doing the work. `crucible tui` without `--demo` said so in as many words --
//! "no sweep is running to attach to" -- and that was true even while a sweep
//! WAS running, if it was running headless. Which is now the normal case, and
//! since 0.28 the normal case is also a launchd agent nobody is attached to.
//!
//! WHY NOT THE SOCKET. crucible-spec §Phase 7 sketches a daemon/attach split
//! over a Unix socket, so "a Zellij restart can't kill a three-day sweep".
//! That solves a control problem this does not have. Everything a dashboard
//! shows is already in the database -- it is the record the sweep itself
//! resumes from -- so a reader needs no protocol, no handshake, and no
//! cooperation from the writer. What falls out of that is worth more than the
//! socket would be:
//!
//!   * it works when NOTHING is running, showing where the set stands;
//!   * any number of terminals can watch at once;
//!   * a viewer cannot perturb the measurement, because it only ever reads;
//!   * and closing it does nothing to the sweep, which was the socket's point.
//!
//! The refresh is deliberately slow (`REFRESH`). The sweep commits a row per
//! transaction and this reads whole boards, so polling at frame rate would put
//! a reader in front of the writer for no gain a human could perceive.
