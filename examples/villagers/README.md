# villagers — the generic, recipe-driven model

The planning model a **live game embeds** — ferroplan's `sim_core` villager
planner: build a PDDL problem from world state, `solve`, map the steps back to
game verbs (walk / gather / craft), replan when done. Counterpart to
[`../rpg-world`](../rpg-world) — same crafting/economy idea, encoded the
*opposite* way.

## Two models, side by side

| | **villagers** (this dir) | **rpg-world** |
|---|---|---|
| Encoding | **generic / data-driven**: 3 actions (`walk`/`gather`/`craft`); recipes, sources, workshops, walk-times are all data in `:init` | **specific**: ~100 hand-written actions, one per recipe |
| Time | **non-durative** — duration is a `(total-time)` cost the `:metric` minimizes (action-costs) | **`:durative-actions`** — real makespan, concurrency, ε-separation |
| ferroplan path | numeric **metric optimization** (`--mode pddl3`) | the **temporal** decision-epoch search (+ the `FF_TDEMAND`/`FF_TDECOMP` decomposer) |
| Recipes | single-input (`recipe ?out ?in`, one `recipe-qty`) | multi-input DAGs (smelt = ore + charcoal; house = planks + bricks) |
| Lines | ~50 | ~1000 |
| Best for | embedding in an app; many agents replanning fast (satisfice) | showcasing deep temporal crafting + goal decomposition |

Neither wins — different trade-offs, both correct for what they're built for.
villagers stays compact, the kind of thing a real consumer writes (recipes as
data, not code); rpg-world runs more expressive (multi-input, real time),
puts the temporal/decomposition features through their paces. Two ends of the
encoding A/B in `benchmarks/encoding-ab`.

## Run it

```sh
# the township scenario: 2 crafting chains over a 7-node map, minimize total-time
ff -o examples/villagers/domain.pddl -f examples/villagers/township.pddl --mode pddl3
# -> a 19-step optimized plan, total-time 38

# the minimal blacksmith errand
ff -o examples/villagers/domain.pddl -f examples/villagers/errand.pddl --mode pddl3
```

`--mode pddl3` runs the metric optimizer (minimize `total-time`); the default
`auto`/`ff` route hands back a faster *satisficing* plan instead — exactly
what the game runs for ambient NPCs (`Options { optimize: false, .. }`).

## Files

- `domain.pddl` — the generic 3-action domain, adapted from `sim_core`'s `village`
  planner (renamed `village`→`villagers` so it doesn't clash with the
  durative [`../village`](../village) survival-builder).
- `errand.pddl` — minimal: gather 2 ore, forge 1 nail.
- `township.pddl` — the one worth watching: chains `wood→plank` and
  `ore→bar→tool` over a real map, laden-walk penalty included, optimizing
  total travel+work time.
