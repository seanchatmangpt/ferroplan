# `rpg-world` — the universal RPG planning domain

`domain.pddl` is the canonical low-level planning domain for a survival /
village-building multiplayer RPG — a whole economy laid out flat, wired for a
planner. **Broad, not deep**: **~120 durative actions** over **~80 numeric
resource stockpiles** and ~100 predicates —

> gathering · woodline · **metallurgy tiers** (copper/tin→bronze, iron→steel,
> precious metals) · **farming** (till/plant/irrigate/harvest→flour) · **animal
> husbandry** (graze/milk/butcher) · **hunting & fishing** · **leatherworking** ·
> **glass & pottery** · **carpentry** · masonry · **weapons & armor** · **combat /
> defense** (clear threats, train guards) · alchemy & **enchanting** · cooking
> recipes · **transport** · construction (build your own workstations, towers,
> temple) · **civic / skill-training** · trade —

wired to worker **roles**, a **reachable** map axiom, a forall-gated village
square. Nobody plans the whole thing at once. A scheduler hands out
**contract-sized sub-tasks** — the field runs on rations, not banquets (see
below).

It runs the whole engine through its paces in one pass:

| feature | in the domain |
|---|---|
| Durative actions | every action has a `:duration` |
| Numeric fluents | `(dist …)` travel times + ~18 resource stockpiles |
| Conditional effects (`when`) | role bonuses (a `woodcutter` chops 2 logs, a `smith` smelts 2 ingots) |
| `forall` effects | `hold-feast` feeds every agent at the hearth |
| Quantified precondition | `build-square` requires **all** house slots built |
| Disjunctive precondition | `forage-food` works in a field **or** a forest |
| Negation | `equip-axe` needs `(not (has-axe ?a))` |
| Derived predicate (axiom) | `reachable` = transitive closure of the map's `link` |

## The decomposition model (how it's meant to be used)

A live game never asks the planner for one monolithic "build the whole
village" order. A higher-level AI/scheduler cuts the world goal into
**contract-sized sub-tasks** — "make 8 planks", "forge 2 axes", "raise the
square" — and hands each to a worker for a time window. ferroplan clears each
contract: an easy, **non-optimal, fast** plan, in and out.

Not a convenience — the architecture itself. The full gather→process→build
chain in one shot overruns the current temporal search ([#45](../../)): a smithing
contract forced to also synthesize its own gathering doesn't solve. Feed it the
same job with raw materials **pre-delivered**, and it clears in 5 actions. So the
decomposition holds the weight: **gathering is one contract, processing
another, building another** — chained through the shared stockpile.

## Validated contracts (`contracts/`)

**23 self-contained sub-tasks, all verified to solve** against `domain.pddl` —
every subsystem covered: gathering, smithing, masonry, textiles, cooking,
alchemy, farming, husbandry, glass/pottery, carpentry, weapons, leatherworking,
hunting, transport, defense, civic, trade, full village builds. A representative
slice below; the directory holds the rest. (Several multi-step crafting chains —
`weapons`, `leatherworking`, `hunting`, `transport` — didn't clear until the
[#45](../../) temporal-search improvement: weighted-`g` + two-phase
helpful-action pruning, which raised the per-contract plan ceiling.)

| contract | what it shows | makespan |
|---|---|---|
| `woodline.pddl` | chop → saw planks + burn charcoal (role bonus) | 16.0 |
| `smithing.pddl` | (raws in) saw + smelt → forge 2 axes | 13.0 |
| `masonry.pddl` | quarry → blocks → build a wall **and** a well | 31.0 |
| `village-square.pddl` | build 2 houses then the square (forall precond) | 29.0 |
| `textiles.pddl` | shear → weave cloth → tailor clothing | 14.0 |
| `feast.pddl` | cook meals → feast (forall feeds everyone) | 6.0 |
| `alchemy.pddl` | mage meditates for mana → brews potions | 8.0 |
| `travel-gather.pddl` | travel a multi-hop map (reachable axiom) → mine | 8.0 |
| `team-build.pddl` | 2 workers split one contract concurrently | 16.0 |
| `trade.pddl` | turn surplus goods into coin at the market | 11.0 |
| `farming.pddl` | till → plant → irrigate → harvest → mill flour | 15.0 |
| `animal-husbandry.pddl` | tend livestock → produce | 3.0 |
| `glass-pottery.pddl` | sand → glass / clay → fired pottery | 15.0 |
| `carpentry-furniture.pddl` | planks → furniture / cart-parts | 11.0 |
| `cooking-recipes.pddl` | ingredients → a cooked recipe | 9.0 |
| `enchanting-magic.pddl` | meditate → enchant a tool with a potion | 12.0 |
| `defense-combat.pddl` | arm a guard → clear a threat | 10.0 |
| `construction-tiers.pddl` | bootstrap a workstation from materials | 35.0 |
| `civic-skills.pddl` | train an apprentice into a role | 23.0 |

**Long chains need decomposing.** A few subsystems (metallurgy, weapons, leather,
hunting, transport) run crafting chains long enough that one contract trying the
whole thing from raw inputs blows the temporal search — the signal to split:
one contract gathers/refines the intermediate, another burns it. Every action
in the domain works fine on its own; keep the contract short and it clears.

## Authoring your own contracts — tips that keep them fast

- Keep each contract **small** (a few goal units); the scheduler chains them.
- **Cluster** the workstations a contract needs at one site — travel costs time.
- Give the worker its tools/role in `:init` (`has-axe`, `smith`, …).
- Initialize every numeric fluent you reference (`(= (logs) 0)`).
- Declare only the **objects/types you actually use** — empty types pass
  clean (a smithing contract needs no building `slot`s on the manifest).
