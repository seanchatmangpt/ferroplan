# RPG crafting example — durative actions + resource allocation

A worked example: ferroplan as the **low-level operational planner** for a
game agent. Gather → craft → build, scheduled against a limited crew.

The primitives a live game needs, laid out here:

| primitive | how it's modeled |
|---|---|
| **Durative actions** | `:durative-action` with `:duration` — chopping/sawing/mining/building take in-world time |
| **Renewable resource** (workers) | a numeric `(workers)` fluent, `decrease` at-start + `increase` at-end, guarded by `(at start (>= (workers) 1))` — held over the action's interval |
| **Consumable resources** (materials) | `(wood)`, `(planks)`, `(stone)` — produced and consumed by the chain |
| **Crafting chain** | chop → saw → build; mine → build |

## Run it

```sh
ff -o examples/rpg/domain.pddl -f examples/rpg/build-1worker.pddl    # serialized, makespan ~19
ff -o examples/rpg/domain.pddl -f examples/rpg/build-3workers.pddl   # parallel,  makespan ~13
```

The only difference between the two problems: `(= (workers) N)`. ferroplan holds
a worker for each in-progress action, releases it at the action's end — crew
size sets how much of the chain runs concurrently. Exactly the
resource-allocation behavior a workforce/contract system needs.

## Notes / current limits

- Plans are **satisficing**, not makespan-optimal — a good plan fast, not a
  proven shortest one. The right trade-off for a live game, where an agent
  plans, acts, replans as the world shifts under it.
- The same pattern models tools (`(axes)`), mana/cooldowns (a fluent that
  regenerates over time), machines — any renewable or consumable resource.
